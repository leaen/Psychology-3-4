### Altered state of consciousness (ASC)
##### See also normal waking consciousness

The term used to describe any state of consciousness that is distinctly different from normal waking consciousness, in terms of level of awareness and experience, and the quality or intensity of sensations, perceptions, thoughts feelings and memories that are experienced.

### Amygdala

### Anosognosia

Anosognosia is a deficit of self-awareness, a condition in which a person who suffers some disability seems unaware of the existence of his or her disability.

### Aphasia

A condition characterised by speech impairment. This is often a result of damage to Broca's area or Werenicke's area.

### Attention
##### See also selective attention, divided attention

Attention is a concentration of mental activity that involves focusing on a specific stimulus while ignoring other stimuli.

### Atkinson-Shiffrin's multi-store model of memory

The Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory was designed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin in 1968. The model focusses on three major systems of memory - sensory, short-term and long-term. Each system interacts with others continually with each system having unique characteristics including storage capacity and storage duration.

### Autonomic nervous system
##### See also peripheral nervous system

The autonomic nervous system is a subsystem of the peripheral nervous system that deals with physiological responses to situations that are potentially dangerous. It connects the CNS to the vital organs like the lungs and heart. It is labelled as being autonomous as the organs it controls are largely involuntarily controlled.

The autonomic nervous system functions at all times, even while asleep.

### Automatic processes
##### See also controlled processes

Automatic processes are processes that can be completed with divided attention. They generally do not require significant cognitive effort.

### Broca's aphasia
##### Also known as non-fluent aphasia

A condition in which language production is severely impaired as a result to damage of Broca's area (usually by a stroke).

### Broca's area

A small area in the frontal lobe which is reasonable for coordinating the muscles needed speech production. Damage to Broca's area results in Broca's aphasia (also known as expressive aphasia). Broca's area is found in th e left hemisphere for 95% of patients.

### Carry-over effects
##### See also order effects

The influence of the effects made by a previous treatment or task on a participants performance as measured by the DV.

Examples include:
- In an experiment concerning the affect of alcohol on driving performance, it is important to give the participants alcohol after the sober test but before the second test.

### Central nervous system
##### Also known as CNS

The CNS is constructed from the brain and the spinal cord. It transmits messages to and from the peripheral nervous system via the spinal cord.

### Central sulcus

The prominent fold between the frontal and parietal lobe as well as the primary motor cortex from the primary somatosensory cortex.

### Cerebral cortex

The cerebral cortex is the 2-4mm outer layer of the brain. Typically it is split into four lobes for research purposes, although all lobes interact during normal operation.

### Cocktail-party effect
##### See also selective attention

You may find sometimes that when having a conversation with one group at a party or other social gathering, your attention may suddenly shift when you hear your name being used in a conversation somewhere else. Even though you weren't specifically giving that seperate conversation attention, your body still processes it.

### Confounding variables
##### See also extraneous variables

A confounding variable refers to any variable other than the IV that has an unwanted effect on the DV, *making it impossible to determine what has caused the DV.*

A confounding variable is different to an EV as it has a systematic/measureable effect.

Examples include:
- In an experiment looking at the difficulty of two video game levels, participants are asked to play both levels taking a short break between. However when playing level 1, the participants sat only 3m away from the tv, while when playing level they sat 6m away from the tv. The mean score for level 1 was higher than the mean score for level 2. However, the distance that the participants sat from the tv is a confounding variable, and the experimenters have no way of telling to what degree sitting further away from the tv made.
- If a repeated measures experimental design has been used but proper counterbalancing wasn't used.

### Corpus callosum

A thick band/bridge of nerve tissue that connects the two hemispheres of the brain along the longitudinal fissure.

### Consciousness
##### See also state of consciousness

The conscious experience is often described as being personal, selective, continuous and changing. Personal as it is subjective to what you think, see and feel. Selective as you can choose to filter out surroundings or focus on something in particular. Continuous as your consciousness never becomes empty. Changing as there is continual change in your focus and thoughts.

Since consciousness is described as a continuum, at any particular point you would experience consciousness ranging from total awareness to complete lack of awareness.

### Context dependent cues
##### Also see state dependent cues

TODO

### Controlled processes
##### See also automatic processes

Controlled processes are processes that require total concentration and selective attention.

### Daydreaming

### Descriptive statistics

Descriptive statistics include:
- Mean
- Mode
- Median
- Range

### Divided attention
##### See also selective attention

Divided attention is a content limitation. Divided attention occurs when you are focusing on tasks that do only requires a minimal mental effort. This often occurs when multitasking.

Divided attention is not impacted much when in an alcohol-induced state or while daydreaming.

Examples include:
- Walking while listening to music

### Elaborative rehersal

Elaborative rehresal is linking new info in a meaningful way with other new info, or old info already stored in LTM. This form of rehersal is far more effective than maintainance rehersal when attempting to store information in long-time memory.

An unintentional bias in drawing conclusions or collecting results from an experiment in order to confirm an experimenters expectations.

Examples include:
- Misreading data
- Misinterpretation of a participant's reaction

### Experimenter effect
##### See also confounding variables, extraneous variables

The experimenter effect refers to the possiblility of actions, biases or expectations made by an experimenter causing a change in a participants response. This is a potentially confounding variable if not controlled for.

Notable studies:

- Clever Hans: the intelligent horse

Examples include:
- When marking an multiple choice test, the researcher may be more leniently when marking one group vs another

### Experimenter expectancy
##### See also experimenter effect

Certain cues or hints made by an experimenter towards a participant that could lead to a change in the participant's response.

Examples include:
- Particular facial expressions made towards one group but not another
- Giggling or particular interest for one group
- Any difference in behaviour made by the experimenter between a control and experimental group

### Extraneous variables
##### See also confounding variables

### Measures of retention

TODO

- Recall
- Recognition
- Relearning

### Memory

Memory is defined as the processing, storage and retrival of information accquired through learning, i.e a neurological representation of a past event.

### Motor neurons
##### Also known as efferent neurons

Motor neurons are specialised nerve cells that carry messages to skeletal muscles causing them to contract or relax. These messages contain only voluntary muscle movements.

### Normal waking consciousness (NWC)
##### See also altered states of consciousness (ASC)

Normal waking consciousness is a state of consciousness in which you are alert and aware of stimuli such as feelings, thoughts, and perceptions

### Order effect
##### See also confounding variables

"An order effect is an influence on a particular trial that arises from its position in a sequence of trials" (Heiman, 2002)

Examples include:
- The order of questions on a survey
- In an experiment concerning the affect of alcohol on driving performance, it is important to give the participants alcohol after the sober test but before the second test.

### Perception

A perception is the result of organisation and interpretation of sensory input. For example when you fall over and hit your knee, you perceive pain.

### Peripheral nervous system
##### Also known as PNS

Consists of all the nervous system outside of the brain and spinal cord. Responsible for sensation and motor control. Transmits messages to and from the central nervous system via the spinal cord.

### Placebo
##### See also placebo effect

An inactive or 'fake' stimulus that substitutes the real substance or treatment given to a patient. Placebos are often given to a control group in order to establish a baseline for comparison with changing an IV.

### Placebo effect
##### See also confounding variables, extraneous variables

The placebo effect refers to a change in results due to a participants belief that they are playing the guinea pig. In psychology this is often seen as a change in an individual's behaviour due to the knowledge that they are being tested.

An example of the placebo effect is in an experiment where people are given a sugar pill (which is completely inactive) and told that it is a powerful study-aid tablet, they will often report feeling more alert and focussed, even thought the tablet did nothing.

It is important that for in the example above that both groups are given a tablet that looks legitimate so that both groups experience an placebo effect, and therefore it cannot be a confounding variable.

### Polysomnography

Polysomnography is an intensive research method used to study sleep by monitoring and recording various physiological responses. It is often completed in sleep laboratories due to the large amount of equipment needed.

Instrumentation often used in polysomnography includes:
- Electroencephalograph (EEG)
- Electromyograph (EMG)
- Electro-oculargraph (EOG)

### Practice effects
##### See also order effect

The influence on performance that occurs by a participant having previously completed a task

Examples include:
- Playing a video game level under two conditions without taking a break
- Solving a sudoku under two conditions without taking a break

### Primacy effect
##### See also Serial position effect

The primacy effect refers to the superior recall of items at the beginning of the list. This occurs because more attention is paid to the first few items of the list, making them more likely to be retained in long-term memory.

### RAI

Receives analyses interprets.

### Recency effect
##### See also Serial position effect

The recency effect refers to the superior recall of items at the end of a list. This occurs because the last few items are likely to still be in STM. As a result of this, the superior recall is not apparent when delayed recall occurs.

### Rehersal

The process of consciously manipulating information so that it can aid retrieval

### Retrieval

Retrieval is the process of locating and recovering the stored information from memory so that we are consciously aware of it.

### Selective attention
##### See also divided attention

Selective attention is a content limitation. Selective attention is an example of when you are concerntrating very hard on one task at hand. It is important to note that the inattention on other topics is a subconscious effect, and you have no control until willing yourself to concentrate on something else.

Selective attention is impacted when in an alcohol-induced state or while daydreaming.

Examples include:
- A diver concerntrating when about to make a complex dive
- A chef when plating delicate food

### Self-fulfilling prophecy
##### See also experimenter effect

A self-fulfilling prophecy occurs when an experimenter collects results that they expected to obtain because of hints or cues made by them towards the participants. In this instance the experimenter effect is a confounding variable and the experiment is invalid.

### Self-report

Self-reports are the written or spoken responses from a participant to questions or statements given by a researcher

### Semantic network theory

First proposed by Allan Collins in 1969, the semantic network theory is based on the idea of concepts called nodes being linked together through meaningful connections to create a hiearchical structure called a network.

### Sensation

A sensation is the information from a sensory input with any interpretation.

### Sensory memory

Sensory memory is the entry point of memory where new incoming memory is stored for a very brief period.

### Sensory neurons
##### Also known as afferent neurons

Sensory neurons are specialised nerve cells that recieve and carry sensory messages.

### Serial position effect

The serial position refers to the finding that free recall is better for items at the start and end of a list than items in the middle.

### Short-term memory (STM)

Short-term memory (STM) is a memory system with limited storage capcity in which information is stored for a relatively short time, unless renewed in some way.

### Sleep
##### See also alterted state of consciousness

Sleep is a naturally occuring ASC often characterised by a loss of conscious awareness. Sleep is often studied by use of polysomnography.

### Somatic nervous system
##### See also peripheral nervous system

The somatic nervous system is a subsystem of the peripheral nervous system that deals with sending sensory information from muscles and organs to the CNS and receiving motor information from the CNS and passing it onto muscles and organs.

### Spatial neglect syndrome

Spatial Neglect is an attentional disorder in which the person affected systematically ignores stimuli on one side. This condition is usually a result of damage to the right parietal lobe.

### Split-brain surgery
##### Also known as commissurotomy

A surgery in which the corpus callosum is severed, effectively seperating the two cerebral hemispheres.

### Spreading activation

Spreading activation (introduced by Collins and Loftus in 1975) suggests that activation of a single node in a semantic network increases the likelihood of neighbouring nodes also being activated.

### State dependent cues
##### Also see context dependent cues
