### Altered state of consciousness (ASC)
##### See also normal waking consciousness

The term used to describe any state of consciousness that is distinctly different from normal waking consciousness, in terms of level of awareness and experience, and the quality or intensity of sensations, perceptions, thoughts feelings and memories that are experienced.

### Automatic processes
##### See also controlled processes

Automatic processes are processes that can be completed with divided attention. They generally do not require significant cognitive effort.

### Carry-over effects
##### See also order effects

The influence of the effects made by a previous treatment or task on a participants performance as measured by the DV.

Examples include:
- In an experiment concerning the affect of alcohol on driving performance, it is important to give the participants alcohol after the sober test but before the second test.

### Cocktail-party effect
##### See also selective attention

You may find sometimes that when having a conversation with one group at a party or other social gathering, your attention may suddenly shift when you hear your name being used in a conversation somewhere else. Even though you weren't specifically giving that seperate conversation attention, your body still processes it.

### Confounding variables
##### See also extraneous variables

A confounding variable refers to any variable other than the IV that has an unwanted effect on the DV, *making it impossible to determine what has caused the DV.*

A confounding variable is different to an EV as it has a systematic/measureable effect.

Examples include:
- In an experiment looking at the difficulty of two video game levels, participants are asked to play both levels taking a short break between. However when playing level 1, the participants sat only 3m away from the tv, while when playing level they sat 6m away from the tv. The mean score for level 1 was higher than the mean score for level 2. However, the distance that the participants sat from the tv is a confounding variable, and the experimenters have no way of telling to what degree sitting further away from the tv made.
- If a repeated measures experimental design has been used but proper counterbalancing wasn't used.

### Consciousness
##### See also state of consciousness

The conscious experience is often described as being personal, selective, continuous and changing. Personal as it is subjective to what you think, see and feel. Selective as you can choose to filter out surroundings or focus on something in particular. Continuous as your consciousness never becomes empty. Changing as there is continual change in your focus and thoughts.

Since consciousness is described as a continuum, at any particular point you would experience consciousness ranging from total awareness to complete lack of awareness.

### Controlled processes
##### See also automatic processes

Controlled processes are processes that require total concentration and selective attention.

### Daydreaming
##### See also altered state of consciousness

Daydreaming is an ASC in which an individual shifts away from external stimuli to instead focus on internal thoughts

### Divided attention
##### See also selective attention

Divided attention is a content limitation. Divided attention occurs when you are focusing on tasks that do only requires a minimal mental effort. This often occurs when multitasking.

Divided attention is not impacted much when in an alcohol-induced state or while daydreaming.

Examples include:
- Walking while listening to music

### Experimenter bias
##### See also experimenter effect

An unintentional bias in drawing conclusions or collecting results from an experiment in order to confirm an experimenters expectations.

Examples include:
- Misreading data
- Misinterpretation of a participant's reaction

### Experimenter effect
##### See also confounding variables, extraneous variables

The experimenter effect refers to the possiblility of actions, biases or expectations made by an experimenter causing a change in a participants response. This is a potentially confounding variable if not controlled for.

Notable studies:
- Lenore Jacobson (1968)
- Clever Hans: the intelligent horse

Examples include:
- When marking an multiple choice test, the researcher may be more leniently when marking one group vs another

### Experimenter expectancy
##### See also experimenter effect

Certain cues or hints made by an experimenter towards a participant that could lead to a change in the participant's response.

Examples include:
- Particular facial expressions made towards one group but not another
- Giggling or particular interest for one group
- Any difference in behaviour made by the experimenter between a control and experimental group

### Extraneous variables
##### See also confounding variables

A variable that relates to the IV or the DV and may have an effect on them.

Examples include:
- Individual participant differences

### Individual participant differences
##### See also confounding variables, extraneous variables

Individual participant differences are differences in the the individual participants that could lead to change in the outcome of the experiment due to personal characteristics.

Examples include:
- Age
- Biological sex
- Intelligence
- Religion
- Education background
- Personality
- Ethnicity
- Mood
- Physical health

### Normal waking consciousness (NWC)
##### See also altered states of consciousness (ASC)

Normal waking consciousness is a state of consciousness in which you are alert and aware of stimuli such as feelings, thoughts, and perceptions

### Order effect
##### See also confounding variables

"An order effect is an influence on a particular trial that arises from its position in a sequence of trials" (Heiman, 2002)

Examples include:
- The order of questions on a survey
- In an experiment concerning the affect of alcohol on driving performance, it is important to give the participants alcohol after the sober test but before the second test.

### Placebo
##### See also placebo effect

An inactive or 'fake' stimulus that substitutes the real substance or treatment given to a patient. Placebos are often given to a control group in order to establish a baseline for comparison with changing an IV.

### Placebo effect
##### See also confounding variables, extraneous variables

The placebo effect refers to a change in results due to a participants belief that they are playing the guinea pig. In psychology this is often seen as a change in an individual's behaviour due to the knowledge that they are being tested.

An example of the placebo effect is in an experiment where people are given a sugar pill (which is completely inactive) and told that it is a powerful study-aid tablet, they will often report feeling more alert and focussed, even thought the tablet did nothing.

It is important that for in the example above that both groups are given a tablet that looks legitimate so that both groups experience an placebo effect, and therefore it cannot be a confounding variable.

### Practice effects
##### See also order effect

The influence on performance that occurs by a participant having previously completed a task

Examples include:
- Playing a video game level under two conditions without taking a break
- Solving a sudoku under two conditions without taking a break

### Selective attention
##### See also divided attention

Selective attention is a content limitation. Selective attention is an example of when you are concerntrating very hard on one task at hand. It is important to note that the inattention on other topics is a subconscious effect, and you have no control until willing yourself to concentrate on something else.

Selective attention is impacted when in an alcohol-induced state or while daydreaming.

Examples include:
- A diver concerntrating when about to make a complex dive
- A chef when plating delicate food

### Self-fulfilling prophecy
##### See also experimenter effect

A self-fulfilling prophecy occurs when an experimenter collects results that they expected to obtain because of hints or cues made by them towards the participants. In this instance the experimenter effect is a confounding variable and the experiment is invalid.

### State of consciousness
##### See also consciousness

A state of consciousness describes the current level of awareness of your internal state and external surroundings, that determines how much information you take in and respond to.

The qualities used to describe a state of consciousness include:
- Level of awareness
- The content of consciousness
- The use of controlled or automatic processes to perform tasks
- Perceptual experiences
- Cognitive abilities
- Emotional awareness
- Self-control
- The experience of time

There are also several physiological changes associated with states of consciousness including:
- Brain wave patterns
- Eye movements
- Heart rate
- Core body temperature
- Electrical conductivity of skin
