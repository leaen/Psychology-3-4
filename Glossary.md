### Carry-over effects
##### See also order effects

The influence of the effects made by a previous treatment or task on a participants performance as measured by the DV.

Examples include:
- In an experiment concerning the affect of alcohol on driving performance, it is important to give the participants alcohol after the sober test but before the second test.

### Confounding variables
##### See also extraneous variables

When an experimenter cannot differentiate between the effects of different factors when establishing a cause for a change in the DV.

Examples include:
- In an experiment looking at the difficulty of two video game levels, participants are asked to play both levels taking a short break between. However when playing level 1, the participants sat only 3m away from the tv, while when playing level they sat 6m away from the tv. The mean score for level 1 was higher than the mean score for level 2. However, the distance that the participants sat from the tv is a confounding variable, and the experimenters have no way of telling to what degree sitting further away from the tv made.
- If a repeated measures experimental design has been used but proper counterbalancing wasn't used.

### Experimenter bias
##### See also experimenter effect

An unintentional bias in drawing conclusions or collecting results from an experiment in order to confirm an experimenters expectations.

Examples include:
- Misreading data
- Misinterpretation of a participant's reaction

### Experimenter effect
##### See also confounding variables, extraneous variables

The experimenter effect refers to the possiblility of actions, biases or expectations made by an experimenter causing a change in a participants response. This is a potentially confounding variable if not controlled for.

Notable studies:
- Lenore Jacobson (1968)
- Clever Hans: the intelligent horse

### Experimenter expectancy
##### See also experimenter effect

Certain cues or hints made by an experimenter towards a participant that could lead to a change in the participant's response.

Examples include:
- Particular facial expressions made towards one group but not another
- Giggling or particular interest for one group
- Any difference in behaviour made by the experimenter between a control and experimental group

### Extraneous variables
##### See also confounding variables

A variable that relates to the IV or the DV and may have an effect on them.

Examples include:
- Individual participant differences

### Individual participant differences
##### See also confounding variables, extraneous variables

Individual participant differences are differences in the the individual participants that could lead to change in the outcome of the experiment due to personal characteristics.

Examples include:
- Age
- Biological sex
- Intelligence
- Religion
- Education background
- Personality
- Ethnicity
- Mood
- Physical health

### Order effect
##### See also confounding variables

"An order effect is an influence on a particular trial that arises from its position in a sequence of trials" (Heiman, 2002)

Examples include:
- The order of questions on a survey
- In an experiment concerning the affect of alcohol on driving performance, it is important to give the participants alcohol after the sober test but before the second test.

### Placebo
##### See also placebo effect

An inactive or 'fake' stimulus that substitutes the real substance or treatment given to a patient. Placebos are often given to a control group in order to establish a baseline for comparison with changing an IV.

### Placebo effect
##### See also confounding variables, extraneous variables

The placebo effect refers to a change in results due to a participants belief that they are playing the guinea pig. In psychology this is often seen as a change in an individual's behaviour due to the knowledge that they are being tested.

An example of the placebo effect is in an experiment where people are given a sugar pill (which is completely inactive) and told that it is a powerful study-aid tablet, they will often report feeling more alert and focussed, even thought the tablet did nothing.

It is important that for in the example above that both groups are given a tablet that looks legitimate so that both groups experience an placebo effect, and therefore it cannot be a confounding variable.


### Practice effects
##### See also order effect

The influence on performance that occurs by a participant having previously completed a task

Examples include:
- Playing a video game level under two conditions without taking a break
- Solving a sudoku under two conditions without taking a break

### Self-fulfilling prophecy
##### See also experimenter effect

A self-fulfilling prophecy occurs when an experimenter collects results that they expected to obtain because of hints or cues made by them towards the participants. In this instance the experimenter effect is a confounding variable and the experiment is invalid.
