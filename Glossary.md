### Confounding variables
##### See also extraneous variables

### Experimenter bias
##### See also experimenter effect

An unintentional bias in drawing conclusions or collecting results from an experiment in order to confirm an experimenters expectations.

Examples include:
- Misreading data
- Misinterpretation of a participant's reaction

### Experimenter effect
##### See also confounding variables, extraneous variables

The experimenter effect refers to the possiblility of actions, biases or expectations made by an experimenter causing a change in a participants response. This is a potentially confounding variable if not controlled for.

Notable studies:
- Lenore Jacobson (1968)

### Experimenter expectancy
##### See also experimenter effect

Certain cues or hints made by an experimenter towards a participant that could lead to a change in the participant's response.

Examples include:
- Particular facial expressions made towards one group but not another
- Giggling or particular interest for one group
- Any difference in behaviour made by the experimenter between the two groups

### Extraneous variables
##### See also confounding variables

### Individual participant differences
##### See also confounding variables, extraneous variables

Individual participant differences are differences in the the individual participants that could lead to change in the outcome of the experiment due to personal characteristics.

Examples include:
- Age
- Biological sex
- Intelligence
- Religion
- Education background
- Personality
- Ethnicity
- Mood
- Physical health

### Placebo
##### See also placebo effect

An inactive or 'fake' stimulus that substitutes the real substance or treatment given to a patient. Placebos are often given to a control group in order to establish a baseline for comparison with changing an IV.

### Placebo effect
##### See also confounding variables, extraneous variables

The placebo effect refers to a change in results due to a participants belief that they are playing the guinea pig. In psychology this is often seen as a change in an individual's behaviour due to the knowledge that they are being tested.

An example of the placebo effect is in an experiment where people are given a sugar pill (which is completely inactive) and told that it is a powerful study-aid tablet, they will often report feeling more alert and focussed, even thought the tablet did nothing.

It is important that for in the example above that both groups are given a tablet that looks legitimate so that both groups experience an placebo effect, and therefore it cannot be a confounding variable.

### Self-fulfilling prophecy
##### See also experimenter effect

A self-fulfilling prophecy occurs when an experimenter collects results that they expected to obtain because of hints or cues made by them towards the participants. In this instance the experimenter effect is a confounding variable and the experiment is invalid.
