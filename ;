## States of consciousness
### Consciousness

*Consciouness* - Consciousness is the awareness of objects and events in the external world and of our own existence and mental experiences at any given moment.

#### The conscious experience can be described in the following ways:

- Personal - Consciousness contains an individuals sense of self, and as a result is highly subjective and personal to each person.
- Selective - Since you may voluntarily shift your focus away from certain things, the consciousness experience can be described as selective
- Continuous - Consciousness can never be empty or nil
- Changing - New information is constantly pouring into mind, leading it to new conclusions and views

### States of consciousness

#### Qualities of states of consciousness include:
##### Level of awareness
Attention is a concentration of mental activity that involves focusing on a specific stimulus while ignoring other stimuli. This concerntration may be focussed internally (such as on thoughts and feelings) or externally (such as on a person you're talking to). Shifts in attention can be both intentional and unintentional. For example you may intentionally stop reading a book and instead go watch TV (intentional change), or your phone may ring while you're studying (unintentional change). As level of awareness is a criterion for a state of consciousness, as your level of awareness changes, your conscious awareness changes.

Generally, there are two levels of awareness:

###### Selective attention
Selective attention involves choosing and attending to a specific stimulus to the exclusion of others. It is generally associated with tasks that are complex or require a large amount of cognitive effort. Examples include learning to driving or a comprehension on a story just read to you. Selective attention is required for any controlled process.

When a stimulus is determined to be personally important to us, we are more likely to notice it. An example of this behaviour in action is the 'cocktail party effect'. If you are at a party with loud music and talking to a group of friends, you may find your attention suddenly change when you hear someone say your name in a different conversation.

###### Divided attention
Divided attention refers to the ability to distribute our attention and undertake two or more activites simulatenously. It is the attention associated with activites that can be multi-tasked, or anything that requires a low level of cognitive effort. Examples of activites that can be completed with divided attention include walking, talking and driving (if already an experienced driver).

##### Content limitations
Content limitations refer to the ability for individuals to selectively restrict what is let into the content of their consciousness. During NWC, you are typically able to restrict more content from your consciousness, whereas during an ASC you may not be able to block out as much content. For example when in an alcohol-induced state, an individual may not be able to block out feelings and emotions to the same degree as if they were in NWC, often leading them to experience more emotional outbursts.

##### Controlled processes
A controlled process involves conscious, alert awareness and mental effort in which the individual actively focuses their attention on achieving a particular goal. Controlled processes are often required for tasks that involve new experiences in which the brain is not as familar with.The flow of information can be described as _serial_ meaning that information much be processed one after another and not simultaneously. Controlled processes require high levels of cognitive effort to be dedicated to the task. Controlled processes include learning to drive, learning a new board game and rock climbing.

##### Automatic processes
An automatic process requires little conscious awareness and mental effort, minimal attention and does not interfere with the performance of other activities. Automatic processing is most often used for tasks that are familiar to an individual and that are completed often. The flow of information can be described as _parallel_ meaning that during automatic processing an individual may be able to complete two or more tasks simulatenously.

Automatic processing can be illustrated with the Stroop effect, in which participants are shown cards with coloured words on them. Participants are asked to read aloud the colour of each word. In cases where the colour of the word and the word itself are congruent, the participant responsed the quickest. In cases where there was a mismatch of colour and the word (e.g the word 'blue' in red ink) participants often took longer to respond and were incorrect more often. This shows that the automatic process of reading the word often completes quicker than the more complicated task of interpreting the colour of the word (a controlled process).

#### Characteristics of ASCs

##### Time orientation
Estimation and the 'feel' of time is often impaired during an ASC. Individuals may feel that time passes slower or more quickly than the rate at which real time progresses. For example when falling asleep you do not feel as if you have been asleep for several hours, instead you feel as if you were just awake before.

##### Emotional awareness
During ASCs, individuals may find themselves becoming more emotional or erractic in behaviour. They could feel less inhibited and show their emotions more. Unexpected or inappropriate emotional reactions such as laughing at the news that a family member may also occur. Quick swings in mood are also particularly common when in an alcohol-induced state, for example someone may become suddenly agressive for no apparent reason.

##### Perceptual and cognitive distortions

Perceptions and interpretations of surroundings may be distorted during an ASC. For example in a drug-induced state individuals may percieve inanimate objects as being alive and talking (hallucations). Individuals may lose the sense of who they are. ASCs may also enhance senses, making smells stronger, colours more vibrant etc. Cognitive functioning may also be impaired during an ASC, individuals may struggle to think in logical ways or become much less adept at problem-solving.

##### Self-control

---

As level of awareness changes, different states of consciousness are able to be experienced. This is possible due to the changing aspect of the consciousness experience.

As level of awareness changes over a spectrum, states of consciousness can be generalised on a spectrum from total awareness (focussed attention, NWC) to a complete lack of awareness (anaesthesised state, unconcious).

#### Normal waking consciousness

Normal waking consciousness or NWC refers to the states of consciousness associated with being awake and aware of our thoughts, memories, feelings and the sensations we are experiencing from the outside world.

#### Altered states of consciousness
#### Differences from NWC
A ASC is any state of consciousness that is distinctly different from NWC. This may be in terms of level of awareness, and the quality or intensity of sensations, perceptions, thoughts, feelings and memories that are experienced.

- Daydreaming
- Alcohol-induced state
- Sleep, "purpose of sleep, characteristics and patterns of the stages of sleep including rapid eye movement (REM) and the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stages of sleep" - vcaa


methods used to study the level of alertness in normal waking consciousness and the stages of sleep:
- polysomnography

measurement of physiological responses including electroencephalograph (EEG), electromyograph (EMG), electro-oculargraph (EOG), heart rate, body temperature and galvanic skin response (GSR)
- eeg
- eog
- emg
- gsr

the use of sleep laboratories, video monitoring and self reports
the effects of total and partial sleep depreviation:
- loss of REM and NREM sleep
- sleep recovery patterns including amount of sleep required, REM rebound and microsleeps
- sleep-wake cycle shifts during adolescence compared with child and adult sleep including delayed onset of sleep and need for sleep
