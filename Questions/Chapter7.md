#### Draw a diagram of a neuron and label key structual features

![Neuron and synapse](http://biomedicalengineering.yolasite.com/resources/neuron_structure.jpg)

#### What is the difference between a synapse and synaptic gap?

The synapse is the communication between two adjacent neurons whereas the synaptic gap is the small seperation between the axon terminals of the pre-synaptic neuron and the dendrites of the post-synaptic neuron.

#### What is synaptic growth?

Synaptic growth refers to the development of extra synapses.

#### What is a 'memory circuit'?

Memory circuits are the interconnected neurons that makeup memories.

---

Describe the role each of the following has in memory formation:

#### the axon and its terminals

The axon and its terminals are responsible for the sending of information to other neurons and allow for the communication with other cells to form memory.

#### dendrites

Dendrites pull in information and neurotransmitters that have been pushed over the synaptic gap by other neurons allow the cell to be influenced and change in order to develop memory.

#### synapses

The site where communication between two neurons takes place.

#### synaptic connections

Allow for memory circuits to form.

#### neurotransmitters

Neurotransmitters are the chemical messages that are transferred over the synapse>

#### What is the hippocampus and where is it located?

The hippocampus is a 3.5cm long tube-like cortical structure located in the medial temporal lobe of each hemisphere.

#### Who is H.M. and why is he well known to memory researchers?

H.M. or Henry Molaison is a patient who in an attempt to treat severe epilepsy had the majority of his medial temporal lobe surgically removed. Due to his very specific circumstances he is of interest to neurologists and psychologists studying memory.

#### List the STM and LTM memory impairments experienced by H.M. after his surgery and what these indicate about the roles played and not played by the hippocampus in memory

Molaison's STM was not impaired in any significant way, however, Molaison lost the ability to store new long-term declarative memories. He did however retain the ability to retrieve and learn new procedural memories, as well as retrieve previously learn declarative memories (although a large portion of approximately 2 years before his surgery were lost). This indicates that the hippocampus is likely to have a role in the consolidation of new declarative memories.

#### What does the H.M. case study suggest about where LTMs are stored in the brain? Explain with reference to the case study.

Henry's ability to retrieve the majority of his existing memories suggests that memories are actually stored in the hippocampus or the amygdala, but instead in other areas of the brain.

# Learning Activity 7.5

#### Where is the amygdala located?

The amygdala is located at the front of the hippocampus in a small bulb like shape within the medial temporal lobe.

#### What role(s) does the amygdala play in implicit memory?

Contributes to the creation of conditioned emotional responses.

#### What role(s) does the amygdala play in explicit memory?

May contribute to the activation of the hippocampus to stimulate memory storage.

#### Why are conditioned emotional responses said to involve implicit memory?

Conditioned emotional responses are said to involve implicit memory as there is no attempt or intention to access the memories but they are involuntarily retrieved in the prescence of a triggering stimulus.

#### How does the hippocampus recieve information about an emotional event from the amygdala?

Heightened concerntrations of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine in the amygdala during the prescene of emotionally arousing stimuli has been identified as a way that the hippocampus is signalled to 'tag' a memory.

#### What role does the hippocampus play in the formation of emotional memories?

The hippocampus strengthens the emotional memories in long-term storage.

#### Identify the independent and dependent variables in the study by Antoine Bechara and colleagues (1995)

IV: The type of brain damage experienced by a patient
DV: Whether the patient experienced a conditional fear response and whether the patient recalled the experiment

Callie was badly bitten by her neighbour's dog yesterday. Describe what would happen if Callie saw the dog today under each of the following conditions:

#### No amygdala or hippocampal damage

Callie would see the dog, recognise it and experience an emotional response.

#### Bilateral amygdala damage

Callie would see the dog, recognise it but not experience an emotional response.

#### Bilateral hippocampal damage

Callie would see the dog, not recognise it but experience an emotional response.
