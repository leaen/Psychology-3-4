#### What is the difference between a synapse and synaptic gap?

The synapse is the communication between two adjacent neurons whereas the synaptic gap is the small seperation between the axon terminals of the pre-synaptic neuron and the dendrites of the post-synaptic neuron.

#### What is synaptic growth?

Synaptic growth refers to the development of extra synapses.

#### What is a 'memory circuit'?

Memory circuits are the interconnected neurons that makeup memories.

---

Describe the role each of the following has in memory formation:

#### the axon and its terminals

The axon and its terminals are responsible for the sending of information to other neurons and allow for the communication with other cells to form memory.

#### dendrites

Dendrites pull in information and neurotransmitters that have been pushed over the synaptic gap by other neurons allow the cell to be influenced and change in order to develop memory.

#### synapses

The site where communication between two neurons takes place.

#### synaptic connections

Allow for memory circuits to form.

#### neurotransmitters

Neurotransmitters are the chemical messages that are transferred over the synapse>
