#### Draw a diagram of a neuron and label key structual features

![Neuron and synapse](http://biomedicalengineering.yolasite.com/resources/neuron_structure.jpg)

#### What is the difference between a synapse and synaptic gap?

The synapse is the communication between two adjacent neurons whereas the synaptic gap is the small seperation between the axon terminals of the pre-synaptic neuron and the dendrites of the post-synaptic neuron.

#### What is synaptic growth?

Synaptic growth refers to the development of extra synapses.

#### What is a 'memory circuit'?

Memory circuits are the interconnected neurons that makeup memories.

---

Describe the role each of the following has in memory formation:

#### the axon and its terminals

The axon and its terminals are responsible for the sending of information to other neurons and allow for the communication with other cells to form memory.

#### dendrites

Dendrites pull in information and neurotransmitters that have been pushed over the synaptic gap by other neurons allow the cell to be influenced and change in order to develop memory.

#### synapses

The site where communication between two neurons takes place.

#### synaptic connections

Allow for memory circuits to form.

#### neurotransmitters

Neurotransmitters are the chemical messages that are transferred over the synapse>

# Learning Activity 7.4

#### What is the hippocampus and where is it located?

The hippocampus is a 3.5cm long tube-like cortical structure located in the medial temporal lobe of each hemisphere.

#### Who is H.M. and why is he well known to memory researchers?

H.M. or Henry Molaison is a patient who in an attempt to treat severe epilepsy had the majority of his medial temporal lobe surgically removed. Due to his very specific circumstances he is of interest to neurologists and psychologists studying memory.

#### List the STM and LTM memory impairments experienced by H.M. after his surgery and what these indicate about the roles played and not played by the hippocampus in memory

Molaison's STM was not impaired in any significant way, however, Molaison lost the ability to store new long-term declarative memories. He did however retain the ability to retrieve and learn new procedural memories, as well as retrieve previously learn declarative memories (although a large portion of approximately 2 years before his surgery were lost). This indicates that the hippocampus is likely to have a role in the consolidation of new declarative memories.

#### What does the H.M. case study suggest about where LTMs are stored in the brain? Explain with reference to the case study.

Henry's ability to retrieve the majority of his existing memories suggests that memories are actually stored in the hippocampus or the amygdala, but instead in other areas of the brain.

# Learning Activity 7.5

#### Where is the amygdala located?

The amygdala is located at the front of the hippocampus in a small bulb like shape within the medial temporal lobe.

#### What role(s) does the amygdala play in implicit memory?

Contributes to the creation of conditioned emotional responses.

#### What role(s) does the amygdala play in explicit memory?

May contribute to the activation of the hippocampus to stimulate memory storage.

#### Why are conditioned emotional responses said to involve implicit memory?

Conditioned emotional responses are said to involve implicit memory as there is no attempt or intention to access the memories but they are involuntarily retrieved in the prescence of a triggering stimulus.

#### How does the hippocampus recieve information about an emotional event from the amygdala?

Heightened concerntrations of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine in the amygdala during the prescene of emotionally arousing stimuli has been identified as a way that the hippocampus is signalled to 'tag' a memory.

#### What role does the hippocampus play in the formation of emotional memories?

The hippocampus strengthens the emotional memories in long-term storage.

#### Identify the independent and dependent variables in the study by Antoine Bechara and colleagues (1995)

IV: The type of brain damage experienced by a patient
DV: Whether the patient experienced a conditional fear response and whether the patient recalled the experiment

Callie was badly bitten by her neighbour's dog yesterday. Describe what would happen if Callie saw the dog today under each of the following conditions:

#### No amygdala or hippocampal damage

Callie would see the dog, recognise it and experience an emotional response.

#### Bilateral amygdala damage

Callie would see the dog, recognise it but not experience an emotional response.

#### Bilateral hippocampal damage

Callie would see the dog, not recognise it but experience an emotional response.

# Learning Activity 7.6

#### Briefly describe consolidation theory

Consolidation theory suggests that physical changes occur when memory becomes permanently established.

#### What three conditions are necessary for memory to be consolidated and therefore permanentyl stored?

- Enough time (at least 30 minutes) to consolidate the memory
- No disruption should occur during consolidation
- ? Check notes

#### Use consolidation theory to explain why a rugby player who is knocked unconscious during a game may be unable to remember how he was knocked unconscious.

The player's memory up until the point of his impact were effected by his collision, causing him to not successfully consolidate memories in the 30 minutes before being knocked unconscious>

#### Give an example of research evidence for the hippocampus having a crucial role in consolidation

Henry Molaison who was an epilepsy patient who had his hippocampus surgically removed. After his surgery, it was found he had lost the ability to construct and consolidate new declarative memeories, suggesting that the hippocampus plays a crucial role in memory consolidation.

#### Construct a research hypothesis for the experiment conducted by Hudspeth, McGaugh and Thomson (1964). Ensure you operationalise the variables.

It was hypothesised that rats who experienced ECT sooner after learning to complete a maze would remember less of the maze when retested compared to rats who experienced a greater delay before administration of ECT.

#### Briefly describe reconsolidation theory.

When memories are accessed, they must be consolidated again in order to be stored.

#### Explain how reconsolidation may account for retrieval of distorted memories.

When memories are accessed they may not be reconsolidated in an identical manner, leading them to change and morph into distorted accounts of the original memory.

#### Reconsolidation theory suggests that a drug could be developed to erase unwanted or inappropriate memories. Suggest how a drug might be used for memory erasure with reference to reconsolidation theory.

A drug that changes the mood of an individual while they consolidate memory could potentially modify that memory.

#### Give an example of an ethical issue that may be relevant to intentional memory erasure

Withdrawl rights and consent may be difficult to give.
