![Neuron and synapse](http://biomedicalengineering.yolasite.com/resources/neuron_structure.jpg)

#### What is the difference between a synapse and synaptic gap?

The synapse is the area where communication occurs between two adjacent neurons which is inclucsive of the synaptic gap, which is the small seperation between the axon terminals of the pre-synaptic neuron and the dendrites of the post-synaptic neuron.

#### What is synaptic growth?

Synaptic growth refers to the development of extra synapses between neurons in a neural pathway.

#### What is a 'memory circuit'?

Memory circuits are neural pathways of interconnected neurons that are collectively involved in the formation and storage of memories.

---

Describe the role each of the following has in memory formation:

#### the axon and its terminals

The axon and its terminals are responsible for the sending of information via secretion of neurotransmitter to the dendrites of other neurons, allowing for communication with neurons within a memory circuit.

#### dendrites

Dendrites are thin extensions from the soma that receive neurotransmitter that has been sent over the synaptic gap by adjacent neurons within a memory circuit, allowing the neuron to be influenced and change in order to form memories.

#### synapses

The site where communication via neurotransmitter between two adjacent neurons in a memory circuit takes place, thereby making memory formation possible.

#### synaptic connections

Allow for communication between pre-synaptic and post-synpatic neurons within a memory circuit, thereby making memory formation possible.

#### neurotransmitters

Neurotransmitters enable the encoding of memories within memory circuits and contribute to structural changes within the synapse that are important for memory formation and storage.

#### What is the hippocampus and where is it located?

The hippocampus is a 3.5cm long tube-like cortical structure located in the medial temporal lobe of each hemisphere. It is involved in the formation and retrieval of declarative memory.

#### Who is H.M. and why is he well known to memory researchers?

H.M., or Henry Molaison is a patient who in an attempt to treat severe epilepsy had the majority of his medial temporal lobe surgically removed. As a result of the surgery, H.M. experienced serious memory problems. Due to his very specific circumstances he is of interest to neurologists and psychologists studying memory.

#### List the STM and LTM memory impairments experienced by H.M. after his surgery and what these indicate about the roles played and not played by the hippocampus in memory

Molaison's STM was not impaired in any significant way, however, Molaison lost the ability to store new long-term declarative (explicit) memories - the process of transferring memories from STM to LTM with rehearsal was affected. He did however retain the ability to retrieve and learn new procedural memories, as well as retrieve previously learnt declarative memories (although a large portion of approximately 2 years in length was lost). This indicates that the hippocampus is likely to have a role in the consolidation of new declarative memories.

#### What does the H.M. case study suggest about where LTMs are stored in the brain? Explain with reference to the case study.

Henry's ability to retrieve the majority of his existing memories suggests that memories are not actually stored in the hippocampus or the amygdala, but instead in other areas of the brain.

# Learning Activity 7.5

#### Where is the amygdala located?

The amygdala is located at the front of the hippocampus in a small bulb like shape within the medial temporal lobe.

#### What role(s) does the amygdala play in implicit memory?

Contributes to the creation of conditioned emotional or fear responses.

#### What role(s) does the amygdala play in explicit memory?

Contributes to the formation of explicit declarative memories by activating of the hippocampus. This attaches significance to episodic memories, stimulating the hippocampus to store emotional details.

#### Why are conditioned emotional responses said to involve implicit memory?

Conditioned emotional responses are said to involve implicit memory as there is no attempt or intention to access the memories but they are involuntarily retrieved in the prescence of a triggering stimulus.

#### How does the hippocampus recieve information about an emotional event from the amygdala?

Heightened concerntrations of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine in the amygdala during the prescene of emotionally arousing stimuli has been identified as a way that the hippocampus is signalled to 'tag' a memory.

#### What role does the hippocampus play in the formation of emotional memories?

The hippocampus encodes the emotional details of an event in the memory trace.

#### Identify the independent and dependent variables in the study by Antoine Bechara and colleagues (1995)

IV: The type of brain damage experienced by a patient
DV: Whether the patient experienced a conditional fear response and whether the patient recalled the experiment

Callie was badly bitten by her neighbour's dog yesterday. Describe what would happen if Callie saw the dog today under each of the following conditions:

#### No amygdala or hippocampal damage

Callie would see the dog, recognise it and experience an emotional response.

#### Bilateral amygdala damage

Callie would see the dog, recognise it but not experience an emotional response.

#### Bilateral hippocampal damage

Callie would see the dog, not recognise it but experience an emotional response.

# Learning Activity 7.6

#### Briefly describe consolidation theory

Consolidation theory suggests that for information to be successfully transferred to LTM, time must pass without interruption and a physical change must occur.

#### What three conditions are necessary for memory to be consolidated and therefore permanentyl stored?

- Enough time (at least 30 minutes) to consolidate the memory
- No disruption should occur during consolidation
- Physical change must occur (increased number of synaptic sites)

#### Use consolidation theory to explain why a rugby player who is knocked unconscious during a game may be unable to remember how he was knocked unconscious.

The player's memory up until the point of his impact were effected by his collision, causing him to not successfully consolidate memories in the 30 minutes before being knocked unconscious.

#### Give an example of research evidence for the hippocampus having a crucial role in consolidation

Henry Molaison who was an epilepsy patient who had his hippocampus surgically removed. After his surgery, it was found he had lost the ability to construct and consolidate new declarative memeories, suggesting that the hippocampus plays a crucial role in memory consolidation.

#### Construct a research hypothesis for the experiment conducted by Hudspeth, McGaugh and Thomson (1964). Ensure you operationalise the variables.

It was hypothesised that rats given ECT immediately after learning how to complete a maze would remember less of the maze when retested compared to rats who experienced a greater delay before administration of ECT.

---

#### Briefly describe reconsolidation theory.

Reconsolidation theory proposes that after memories are accessed they must be consolidated again in order to be stored back in LTM.

#### Explain how reconsolidation may account for retrieval of distorted memories.

When memories are accessed they may not be reconsolidated in an identical manner. The memory may be influenced by new information leading them to change into distorted reproductions of the original memory.

#### Reconsolidation theory suggests that a drug could be developed to erase unwanted or inappropriate memories. Suggest how a drug might be used for memory erasure with reference to reconsolidation theory.

A patient may be asked to retrieve a troubling memory and then a drug is administered to interfere with the proper reconsolidation of that memory.

#### Give an example of an ethical issue that may be relevant to intentional memory erasure

Withdrawal rights and consent may be difficult to give.

# Learning Activity 7.7

#### What is amnesia?

Amnesia is the partial or complete inability to access memory temporarily or permanently.

#### Explain the meaning of the phrase 'amnesia resulting from brain trauma and neurodegenerative disease'.

Amnesia that is caused by damage to neural tissue either by brain trauma (any type of brain damage) or neurodegenerative diseases (a result of a progressive decline in the structure, activity and function of brain tissue).

#### Why are Alzheimer's disease and Korsakoff's syndrome considered to be neurodegenerative diseases?

They are both characterised by a progressive decline in the structure and function of brain tissue.

#### Distinguish between amnesia that may result from an inflicted brain injury or from an acquired brain injury.

Amnesia caused by an inflicted brain injury may arise from violent shaking of the head or an intentional blow to the head whereas amnesia caused by an acquired brain injury some time after birth may arise from stroke, brain infection, alcoholism or neurodegenerative diseases.

#### Distinguish between anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia, with reference to an example.

Anterograde amnesia refers to the loss of the ability to form new memories following brain trauma. It is observed in patients with Korsakoff's syndrome.

Retrograde amnesia refers to the loss of the ability to retrieve memories that occured prior to the brain trauma. It is observed in patients who have suffered inflicted brain injuries.

Voula was involved in a car accident as a passenger. She was not wearing a seatbelt and hit her head on the front windscreen when the two cars collided. She was unconscious for a short time. Brain scans showed there was no permanent brain damage; however, Voula experienced memory problems for some time after the accident.

#### If Voula suffered anterograde amnesia, what memory problems is she likely to experience?

Voula may find herself unable to remember the names of doctors and those who she meets.

#### If Voula suffered retrograde amnesia, what memory problems is she likely to experience?

Voula may be unable to recall memories from her accident or up to a few months before the accident.

# Learning Activity 7.8

#### Explain what dementia is with reference to commonly described early and latter stage symptoms

Dementia is an umbrella term for a set of diseases that cause a progressive decline in mental abilities that is not typical of normal aging. Symptoms of dementia include occasional memory loss, a decline in mental abilities and mild behaviour changes in the early stages to severe memory loss, impaired ability to function independently and confusion in the latter stages.

---

#### What is Alzheimer's disease?

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia characterised by gradual and widespread deterioration of neural tissue, memory loss, a decline in social skills and personality changes.

#### Why is Alzheimer's disease irreversible?

Alzheimer's disease is caused by damage to the structure of brain tissue caused by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The brain matter lost by the damage caused cannot be regrown by the body and the damage is consequently permanent.

#### Why is Alzheimer's disease attributable to neurological factors?

Postmortems of people who have died with Alzheimer's disease have shown that up to 75% shrinkage in areas such as the hippocampus. This illustrates that the severity of the disease depends upon the amount of neurological damage caused. Brain matter removed from patients who had Alzheimer's disease also contained amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.

#### Why does Alzheimer's disease ultimately lead to an earlier death?

The brain slowly reduces in functionality until it cannot support the body in regards to coordinating bodily functions.

# Learning Activity 7.9

| Type of memory | Changes associated with age |
| --- | --- |
| Short-term memory | For simple tasks, short-term memory is relatively unaffected, although when completing complex tasks (requiring manipulation of memory or attention being divided between tasks), there is a noticeable reduction in performance. Decline in visuo-spatial sketchpad - progressive loss of ability to follow directions. The nervous system of older people is generally less efficient at transferring information and therefore the rate at which information can be stored or retrieved is slowed. |
| Procedural memories | Procedural memories are mostly resistant to ageing and do not deteriorate |
| Episodic memories | Prospective episodic memory tends to become less effective as an individual grows older however retrospective memory is relatively stable |
| Semantic memories |  |

---

#### What are four explanations of age-related decline in memory?

There are several explanations for the cause of the decline in memory as ageing occurs. Perhaps the most simple refers to a loss confidence in one's memory. Older people typically believe that their memory is growing ineffective, and subsequently behave as though that holds true. Another suggestion made to explain changes in memory is a lack of motivation for older people to memorise content in psychological experiments (such as nonsense syllables) as they have often already 'seen the world'. Thirdly, the measure of retention used to remember information changes greatly how the memory of an individual performs. Elderly performed at a similar level to younger participants in recognition tasks but significantly worse in recall tasks. Finally, the most researched hypothesis for changes in memory over the lifespan is physiological changes such as the shrinking of the frontal lobe and slowing of the CNS. These changes to the brain can lead to cognitive slowing.
