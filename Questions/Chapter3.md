#### What is sleep?

Sleep is a naturally occuring ASC often characterised by a loss of conscious awareness.

#### Why is sleep considered to be an altered state of consciousness?

During sleep, your level of awareness is reduced, the intensity of sensations is reduced and thoughts and memory function is changed.

#### What is polysomnography?

Polysomnography is an intensive research method used to study sleep by monitoring and recording various physiological responses. It is often completed in sleep laboratories due to the large amount of equipment needed.

#### Explain what a self-report is and how it may be used to study sleep, with a reference to an specific self-report method

A self-report is the written or spoken response from a participant to questions given by a researcher. For example, a researcher could give participants a questionaire to measure the current characteristics of the individuals sleep or the effect on an IV.

#### Construct a table that summarises the recording devices that may be used in a sleep study. Headings should include Name

| Name of device | What is it? | What does it measure? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Electroencephalograph (EEG) | | Records brain activity generated by the brain during sleep |
| Electromyograph (EMG) |  | Used to detect, amplify and record the electrical activity of muscles |
| Electro-oculargraph (EOG) | | Measures electrical activity relating to the muscles used to move your eyes |

---

#### Suggest two potential limitations of:
##### Research studies undertaken in a sleep laboratory

In a sleep laboratory. participants may not feel as comfortable or fall asleep as easily.

##### Self-report methods for sleep research

Self-report methods are relatively indirect measurements of sleep patterns. They also usually lack measurement of objective quantitative data.

| Type of sleep | EEG records | EOG records | EMG records | Other physiological responses | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Awake | Beta waves |
| NREM Stage 1 | Mix of alpha and theta waves | --- | --- | Hypnic jerk, blood pressure and body temperature begin to fall | 5-10 minutes |
| NREM Stage 2 | Mostly theta waves with K-complexes | --- | --- | Sleep spindles, K-complexes, blood pressure and body temperature continue to fall | 10-20 minutes |
| NREM Stage 3 | Mix of theta and delta waves | --- | --- | Maximum muscle relaxation | 10 minutes |
| NREM Stage 4 | More than 50% delta waves | --- | --- | Muscles completely relaxed, no physical movement | 10 minutes early during sleep, but can be skipped closer to the morning |
| REM | Beta-like waves | --- | --- | Blood pressure and heartrate increase, eyes have erratic movement | A few minutes early on in sleep up to an hour in later parts of sleep |

#### Briefly describe the pattern and proportions of NREM and REM sleep in a typical night's sleep for an adult

During a normal night's sleep it is expected that 80% of sleep is NREM sleep and 20% of sleep is REM sleep. Although, during the second half of the time spent asleep there is a higher proportion of REM sleep.

#### Why are NREM stages 3 and 4 referred to as slow wave sleep?

During NREM stages 3 and 4, delta waves start to occur. Due to the low frequency of these delta waves, the stages are reffered to as slow wave sleep.

#### Why is REM sleep sometimes referred to as paradoxical sleep?

Traditionally sleep is thought to be a period of low brain activity, but during REM sleep your brain acts like it is fully awake with brain wave patterns similar to those expected in normal waking consciousness.
