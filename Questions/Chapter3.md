#### What is sleep?

Sleep is a naturally occuring ASC often characterised by a loss of conscious awareness.

#### Why is sleep considered to be an altered state of consciousness?

During sleep, your level of awareness is reduced, the intensity of sensations is reduced and thoughts and memory function is changed.

#### What is polysomnography?

Polysomnography is an intensive research method used to study sleep by monitoring and recording various physiological responses. It is often completed in sleep laboratories due to the large amount of equipment needed.

#### Explain what a self-report is and how it may be used to study sleep, with a reference to an specific self-report method

A self-report is the written or spoken response from a participant to questions given by a researcher. For example, a researcher could give participants a questionaire to measure the current characteristics of the individuals sleep or the effect on an IV.

#### Construct a table that summarises the recording devices that may be used in a sleep study. Headings should include Name

| Name of device | What is it? | What does it measure? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Electroencephalograph (EEG) | | Records brain activity generated by the brain during sleep |
| Electromyograph (EMG) |  | Used to detect, amplify and record the electrical activity of muscles |
| Electro-oculargraph (EOG) | | Measures electrical activity relating to the muscles used to move your eyes |

#### Suggest two potential limitations of:
##### Research studies undertaken in a sleep laboratory

In a sleep laboratory. participants may not feel as comfortable or fall asleep as easily.

##### Self-report methods for sleep research

Self-report methods are relatively indirect measurements of sleep patterns. They also usually lack measurement of objective quantitative data.

| Type of sleep | EEG records | EOG records | EMG records | Other physiological responses | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Awake | Beta waves |
| NREM Stage 1 | Mix of alpha and theta waves | --- | Slow-rolling eye movements | Hypnic jerk, blood pressure and body temperature begin to fall, individuals don't feel like they've been asleep | 5-10 minutes |
| NREM Stage 2 | Mostly theta waves with K-complexes | Slow-rolling eye movements | --- | Sleep spindles, K-complexes, blood pressure and body temperature continue to fall | 10-20 minutes |
| NREM Stage 3 | Mix of theta and delta waves | --- | Little eye movement | More muscle relaxation, much more difficult to wake up, more disoriented upon being woken up, NREM dreams | 10 minutes |
| NREM Stage 4 | More than 50% delta waves | --- | No eye movement | Muscles completely relaxed, no physical movement, if woken up during this stage, it will take 10 minutes to reestablish their surroundings, sleep walking occurs, NREM dreams | 10 minutes early during sleep, but can be skipped closer to the morning |
| REM | Beta-like waves | --- | Increased levels of movement | Blood pressure and heartrate increase, eyes have erratic movement, paradoxical sleep, more aware of surroundings, increased GSR, cataplexy, dreaming is more memorable and vivid | A few minutes early on in sleep up to an hour in later parts of sleep |

#### Briefly describe the pattern and proportions of NREM and REM sleep in a typical night's sleep for an adult

During a normal night's sleep it is expected that 80% of sleep is NREM sleep and 20% of sleep is REM sleep. Although, during the second half of the time spent asleep there is a higher proportion of REM sleep.

#### Why are NREM stages 3 and 4 referred to as slow wave sleep?

During NREM stages 3 and 4, delta waves start to occur. Due to the low frequency of these delta waves, the stages are reffered to as slow wave sleep.

#### Why is REM sleep sometimes referred to as paradoxical sleep?

Traditionally sleep is thought to be a period of low brain activity, but during REM sleep your brain acts like it is fully awake with brain wave patterns similar to those expected in normal waking consciousness.

#### Participant 1

##### Stage of sleep: NREM Stage 2
##### Evidence:

Multiple indicators suggest that the participant was in NREM Stage 2 sleep. The EEG patterns show K-complexes which are characteristic of NREM Stage 2 sleep. Along with medium amplitude medium frequency theta waves that also characteristic of NREM Stage 2 sleep. The participant is observed to be aware of their surroundings while asleep reporting that they heard a smash on the floor of the researchers office, and they report feeling like they were 'just dozing'.

#### Participant 2

##### Stage of sleep: REM Sleep
##### Evidence:

Physiological measures including heartrate and blood pressure show that the participant has a high level of activity. The EEG pattern describes beta-like waves. The EOG pattern shows frequent eye movements, a key characteristic of REM sleep. A key observation recorded is that the participant reported vividly detailed dreams.

#### Participant 3

##### Stage of sleep: NREM Stage 4
##### Evidence:

Physiological signs all report very low levels of activity. The EEG shows high amplitude low frequency delta waves, that most often occur during NREM Stage 4 sleep. Limited eye movement and almost complete muscle relaxation are also associated with Stage 4. The participant was observed to be very difficult to awake, and was seen to be disoriented after being woken. The participant also reports having a limited recall of dreaming.

# Learning Activity 3.5

#### Briefly describe two general trends in the pattern and proportions of NREM and REM sleep across the lifespan.

Both NREM and REM sleep are longest after birth and begin to plateau mid adolescence. REM sleep is longest during infancy and drops off during adolescence. NREM sleep peaks during the largest stage of growth between the ages of 2 to 5 years of age, and remains elevated until the end of puberty. The proportion of REM sleep to NREM sleep tends to stay relatively over adulthood and old age, although total sleep requirement shortens towards old age.

#### Compare and contrast sleep-wake patterns of children, adolescents and adults with reference of two distinguishing features of each lifespan stage.

Adolescents undergo a hormonally induced sleep-wake cycle shift, with their biological clocks moving back by about 1 to 2 hours. As a result of this, adolescents typically find it easier to stay up later but more difficult to wake up in the morning. They require a total of about 9 hours of sleep a night. This is substaintially longer than the 7-8 hours requirement for adults, and shorter than the 8-10 requirement for children.

#### Explain the meaning of the term sleep-wake cycle shift

A sleep-wake cycle shift occurs when the bodys biological clock is out of sync with real time

#### Briefly describe the sleep-wake cycle shift that occurs during adolescence

During adolescence, hormonal changes occur that result in melatonin being released later at night than in other stages of development. This leads their biological clock to be able 1-2 hours behind real-time, resulting in them feeling sleepy later than other age groups.

#### What are three potential consequences of this shift?

Adolescents may find it difficult to concerntrate at school as a result of sleep deprivation. They may also be more irritable and more experience drifting off into sleep during the day.

#### To what extent may it be possible to readjust or compensate for this shift? Explain your answer

Engaging in good sleep hygiene trains the body to be closer to real-time and allows adolescence to get off to sleep quicker, resulting in a longer period of sleep. Proposals have been made to also move school start times later in order to compensate for the shifted sleep cycle.

#### Explain the meaning of delayed onset of sleep

Delayed onset of sleep is simply a inability to fall asleep at an ideal time whether it be due to hormonal changes, social stimulation or drug use.

#### Explain the meaning of sleep debt

Sleep debt is sleep that has been missed and is now 'owed'.
