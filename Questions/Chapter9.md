# Learning Activity 9.1

For each of the following examples, identify one or more measures of retention that could be used: free recall (FR), serial recall (SR), cued recall (CR), recognition (RG) or relearning (RL).

##### Remembering a friend's mobile phone number with no cues

SR

##### Playing 'Hangman'

RG

##### Using photos from a trip to describe your experiences

CR

##### Identifying a friend who appears in a news report

CR

##### Remembering the directions to a friend's house

CR, RG

##### Writing out the words of a song from memory

FR, SR

##### Reading back over your textbook before an exam

RL

##### Writing out the words of a song with the music of the song playing in the background

RG

# Learning Activity 9.2

#### Explain the meaning of the term measure of retention

A measure of retention is a tool that allows the level of retained information to be measured.

#### Briefly describe the three different measures of retention, with reference to examples not used in the text.

- **Recall** involves reproduction of information stored in memory.
- **Recognition** involves identifying the correct piece of information around alternatives
- **Relearning** learning information again that has been previously learned and stored in LTM

#### List the three measures of rentention in order of sensitivity

Ascending order of sensitivity

- Recall
- Recognition
- Relearning

#### Choose one concept you have studied this semester and write a question requiring the recall method and a question requiring the recognition method.

Name two functions of the left hemisphere.
Is Wernicke's area located in the frontal, parietal, occipital or temporal lobe?

#### Describe two ways of measuring retention using relearning (the method of savings).

Relearning can measure retention by the number of trials needed to complete the learning or the total time taken to complete the learning.

Ahmed took 30 minutes to learn a list of ten Spanish words when they were first given to him. When he had to relearn them before a test the following week, it took him 5 minutes.

#### Using a method of savings formula, calculate the amount of retention of information from the first learning session to the second learning session.

savings = (30 - 10) / (30) * 100 = 66.67%

#### Explain what this figure means in terms of Ahmed's retention of Spanish words.

A savings score of 66.67% means that 66.67% of the original learned information was retained.

Read Nelson's (1978) research on measures of retention and answer the following questions.

#### Name the experimental design

Repeated measures

#### What is an advantage of using this design for this experiment?

Individual participants differences like memory abilities are controlled for

#### What is a limitation of using this design for this experiment?

Participants are more likely to drop-out which is counter-productive for a long-length study such as this

#### Name the sampling procedure

Convience sampling

#### What question about the ethical value of justice could be raised in relation to the study?

Are the group of psychology students unfairly baring the burden of the psychological research into memory and is it disabling of them?
