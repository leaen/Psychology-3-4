# Learning Activity 9.2

#### Explain the meaning of the term measure of retention

A measure of retention is a tool that allows the level of retained information to be measured.

#### Briefly describe the three different measures of retention, with reference to examples not used in the text.

- **Recall** involves reproduction of information stored in memory without retrieval cues.
- **Recognition** involves identifying the correct piece of information around alternatives.
- **Relearning** learning information again that has been previously learned and stored in LTM.

#### List the three measures of rentention in order of sensitivity

Ascending order of sensitivity

- Recall (least)
- Recognition (middle)
- Relearning (most)

#### Choose one concept you have studied this semester and write a question requiring the recall method and a question requiring the recognition method.

Name two functions of the left hemisphere.
Is Wernicke's area located in the frontal, parietal, occipital or temporal lobe?

---

#### Describe two ways of measuring retention using relearning (the method of savings).

Relearning can measure retention by the number of trials needed to complete the learning or the total time taken to complete the learning.

Ahmed took 30 minutes to learn a list of ten Spanish words when they were first given to him. When he had to relearn them before a test the following week, it took him 5 minutes.

#### Using a method of savings formula, calculate the amount of retention of information from the first learning session to the second learning session.

savings = (30 - 5) / (30) * 100 = 83.33%

#### Explain what this figure means in terms of Ahmed's retention of Spanish words.

A savings score of 83.33% means that 83.33% of the original learned information was retained and as a result it took him about one sixth of the original amount of time it took to learn the list to relearn the list.

Read Nelson's (1978) research on measures of retention and answer the following questions.

#### Name the experimental design

Repeated measures

#### What is an advantage of using this design for this experiment?

Individual participants differences like memory abilities are controlled for

#### What is a limitation of using this design for this experiment?

Participants are more likely to drop-out which is counter-productive for a long-length study such as this

#### Name the sampling procedure

Convenience sampling

#### What question about the ethical value of justice could be raised in relation to the study?

Are the group of psychology students unfairly baring the burden of the psychological research into memory and is it disabling of them?

# Learning Activity 9.5

#### Explain the difference between context dependent and state dependent retrieval cues with reference to an example

State dependent cues rely on the context or internal environmental of the learner being the same during retrieval as it was during learning whereas context dependent cues rely on the state or external environment of the learner being the same during retrieval as it was during learning. An example of a context dependent cue is walking down the street where you first met a partner. An example of a state dependent cue is being under the influence of alcohol and remembering the first time you got drunk.

#### Give an example of an everyday life situation involving both context and state dependent cues

Immediately after an exam sat at school your context is the same as it was during learning and being more relaxed (after the conclusion of the exam) your state is the same as it was during learning. You may suddenly find yourself more able to recall the answers to a test.

#### Explain how context and state dependent cues can improve or enhance retrieval from LTM. For each type of cue, give two relevant examples linked to memory improvement

Subtle changes in the encoding of the memories under different contexts and states leads them to be more readily recalled under the same context and state. E.g you tend to remember happy memories when happy, and when you see a building with personal significance to you, you tend to remember memories associated with that building.

# Learning Activity 9.7

#### What is a mnemonic device?

A mnemonic device is a technique that is used to enhance or improve memory.

#### How do mnemonic devices improve memory?

Mnemonic devices improve retrieval from LTM by creating links between new information and information already stored in LTM by elaborative rehearsal. This means that the newly learnt information is better organised into LTM and therefore easier to retrieve.

---

| Mnemonic device | Type of information best suited | How it is used | Example | Why is it effective |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acronym | Works best with phrases that end up with an easily pronounceable word | Concatenation of the first letter of each word in the phrase | NASA | Each letter in the acronym provides  a cue to remember the next word in the phrase |
| Acrostic | Sequences or lists of words such as the planets, points in an essay or other information | The first letter of each item in the sequence is made into a another word starting with the same letter | E G B D F, every good boy deserves fruit | The first letter of each word in the acrostic acts as a cue for recall |
| Narrative chaining | Lists of abstract nouns | A narrative or story is created that links each item in the list to the next in a meaningful way | way too long to fit cmon | Narrative chaining works by encoding the items at a deeper level by linking them to one another, making it easier to locate and retrieve them |

---

#### Briefly describe three characteristics that the various mnemonic devices have in common

- Mnemonic devices all use information that is already stored in LTM
- Mnemonic devices all aid retrieval of information by usage of cues
- Mnemonic devices elaborate on information, allowing for easier location


# Learning Activity 9.11

#### Define the meaning of memory construction

Memory reconstruction suggests that memories are not static and can change and be reintegrated when new information becomes avaliable.

#### Explain how and why memory construction is believed to occur

Memory construction occurs by integrating new information into the information stored from when an event originally occured.

---

#### Explain what a leading question is with reference to the use of a presupposition

A leading question has content or is phrased in such a way as to suggest what answer is desired or to lead to the desired answer.

#### Give an example of a leading question with a presupposition

How late did the assault occur? (Asked to an eyewitness of an assault in a park, it leads the respondent to tend to reply with a later time)

---

#### Explain, with reference to research evidence, how a leading question can be used to manipulate memory reconstruction by eyewitnesses

After a witness observes a brawl outside a nightclub, if the police ask the witness how hard the man smashed his fist into the bouncer's face, they may give an answer that's influenced by the words used in the question.

#### Explain whether Loftus's research findings on the reconstructive nature of memory are relevant to long-term memories other than episodic memories
