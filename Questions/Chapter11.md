# Learning Activity 11.2

#### What observation led Pavlov to study classical conditioning?

The salivation of dogs to meat powder.

#### Define classical conditioning and briefly describe how it occurs, without referring to any 'technical' terms.

Classical conditioning refers to a type of learning that occurs through the repeated association of two (or more) different stimuli.

#### In what way(s) did restraining the dogs in Pavlov's experiments help to control the potential confounding variables?

The dog would not look at other objects in the room (including the researchers).

---

#### Define and explain the role of each of the different kinds of stimuli and responses in classical conditioning: UCS, UCR, CS, CR

UCS: The original stimulus that produces a response
UCR: The original (involuntary) response to the UCS
CS: The conditioned stimulus that produces a response after conditioning occurs
CR: The conditioned (involuntary) response to the CS

#### Which of the stimuli is originally a neutral stimulus?

The CS is initially a neutral stimulus.

#### Why is it called a neutral stimulus?

The CS is called a neutral stimulus because it causes no response from the organism.

#### Explain the relationship between the neutral stimulus and the conditioned stimulus in classical conditioning.

The CS and UCS are repeatedly exposed together, eventually causing both the UCS and CS to trigger a response.

---

#### At what point in the process of classical conditioning can it be said that a response has been learned?

A response is said to have been learnt when the CS reliably produces a CR that was not previously present.

# Learning Activity 11.3

#### Scenario 1

- UCS: Cyclone Tracey
- CS: The bathroom
- UCR: Hiding in bathroom to protect themselves from the Cyclone
- CR: Fearing bathrooms

#### Scenario 2

- UCS: 9/11
- CS: The sight or sound of low-flying planes
- UCR: Witnessing the planes crash into the WTC
- CR: Anxiety and nervousness

#### Scenario 3

- UCS: An electric shock
- CS: The sound of a buzzer
- UCR: The movement of the participants hand
- CR: The movement of the participants hand

# Learning Activity 11.4

#### Explain the meaning of the term acquisition in relation to classical conditioning

Acquisition is the overall process during which an organism learns to associate two events.

#### What is being acquired?

The association between the UCS and the CS is being acquired.

#### How is it acquired?

The association is acquired through repeated presentations of the UCS and CS together.

#### Describe the relationship between timing and acquisition.

The less time elapsed between the presentation of the UCS and the CS the more effective the conditioning is.

---

#### What does extinction mean in classical conditioning?

Extinction is the gradual decrease in the strength of a CR that occurs when the UCS is no longer presented.

#### When is extinction evident in classical conditioning?

After the repeated presentations of the UCS and CS together stop.

---

#### What does spontaneous recovery mean in classical conditioning?

Spontaneous recovery is the reappearance of a CR after a rest break when it appeared to have been extinguished.

#### When is spontaneous recovery evident in classical conditioning?

Spontaneous recovery is evident in classical conditioning after a rest break.

---

#### What is the key difference between spontaneous recovery and extinction? Explain with reference to an example not used in the text.

Extinction refers to the gradual decrease in the strength of the CR after the UCS is no longer presented whereas spontaneous recovery refers to the reappearance of the CR after a rest break when it appeared to have been extinguished.

#### Explain the meaning of the terms stimulus discrimination and stimulus generalisation in relation to classical conditioning. Refer to an example from everyday life, but not one used in the text.

Stimulus generalisation occurs when an organism responds to stimuli that are similar to the CS but not the same. For example the CS may be a knock on a door but an organism may still respond to a knock on the floor.

Stimulus discrimination occurs when an organism responds only to its CS. For example it may respond to its CS (a clap) but not to a similar sound (a hi5).
