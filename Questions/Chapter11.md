# Learning Activity 11.2

#### What observation led Pavlov to study classical conditioning?

The salivation of dogs to meat powder.

#### Define classical conditioning and briefly describe how it occurs, without referring to any 'technical' terms.

Classical conditioning refers to a type of learning that occurs through the repeated association of two (or more) different stimuli.

#### In what way(s) did restraining the dogs in Pavlov's experiments help to control the potential confounding variables?

The dog would not look at other objects in the room (including the researchers).

---

#### Define and explain the role of each of the different kinds of stimuli and responses in classical conditioning: UCS, UCR, CS, CR

UCS: The original stimulus that produces a response
UCR: The original (involuntary) response to the UCS
CS: The conditioned stimulus that produces a response after conditioning occurs
CR: The conditioned (involuntary) response to the CS

#### Which of the stimuli is originally a neutral stimulus?

The CS is initially a neutral stimulus.

#### Why is it called a neutral stimulus?

The CS is called a neutral stimulus because it causes no response from the organism.

#### Explain the relationship between the neutral stimulus and the conditioned stimulus in classical conditioning.

The CS and UCS are repeatedly exposed together, eventually causing both the UCS and CS to trigger a response.

---

#### At what point in the process of classical conditioning can it be said that a response has been learned?

A response is said to have been learnt when the CS reliably produces a CR that was not previously present.

# Learning Activity 11.3

#### Scenario 1

- UCS: Cyclone Tracey
- CS: The bathroom
- UCR: Hiding in bathroom to protect themselves from the Cyclone
- CR: Fearing bathrooms

#### Scenario 2

- UCS: Witnessing the planes crash into the WTC
- CS: The sight or sound of low-flying planes
- UCR: Shock and terror from seeing 9/11
- CR: Anxiety and nervousness

#### Scenario 3

- UCS: An electric shock
- CS: The sound of a buzzer
- UCR: The movement of the participants hand in response to the electric shock
- CR: The movement of the participants hand in response to the buzzer

# Learning Activity 11.4

#### Explain the meaning of the term acquisition in relation to classical conditioning

Acquisition is the overall process during which an organism learns to associate two events.

#### What is being acquired?

The association between the UCS and the CS is being acquired.

#### How is it acquired?

The association is acquired through repeated presentations of the UCS and CS together.

#### Describe the relationship between timing and acquisition.

The less time elapsed between the presentation of the UCS and the CS the more effective the conditioning is.

---

#### What does extinction mean in classical conditioning?

Extinction is the gradual decrease in the strength of a CR that occurs when the UCS is no longer presented.

#### When is extinction evident in classical conditioning?

After the repeated presentations of the UCS and CS together stop.

---

#### What does spontaneous recovery mean in classical conditioning?

Spontaneous recovery is the reappearance of a CR after a rest break when it appeared to have been extinguished.

#### When is spontaneous recovery evident in classical conditioning?

Spontaneous recovery is evident in classical conditioning after a rest break.

---

#### What is the key difference between spontaneous recovery and extinction? Explain with reference to an example not used in the text.

Extinction refers to the gradual decrease in the strength of the CR after the UCS is no longer presented whereas spontaneous recovery refers to the reappearance of the CR after a rest break when it appeared to have been extinguished.

#### Explain the meaning of the terms stimulus discrimination and stimulus generalisation in relation to classical conditioning. Refer to an example from everyday life, but not one used in the text.

Stimulus generalisation occurs when an organism responds to stimuli that are similar to the CS but not the same. For example the CS may be a knock on a door but an organism may still respond to a knock on the floor.

Stimulus discrimination occurs when an organism responds only to its CS. For example it may respond to its CS (a clap) but not to a similar sound (a hi5).

# Learning Activity 11.5

When she was about eight years old, Elizabeth decided to help her mother at the florist's store where her mother worked. She first helped on Valentine's Day. Elizabeth did such a good job bringing in all the red roses for her mother to arrange that she was paid $20. But at the end of the day, nearly every finger on Elizabeth's hands was bleeding  because of the thorns on the red roses. On Mother's Day that year, Elizabeth worked at the florist's store again. Although she earned another $20, her hands were again very sore at the end of the day from the thorns on the red roses.

The following week when her mother asked Elizabeth to assist with preparing flowers for a large wedding, Elizabeth replied that she would help as long as there were no red flowers involved.

#### Elizabeth's refusal to handle red flowers is an example of what?

Elizabeth was conditioned to feel nervous around handling red flowers as she on two separate occasions injured her hands when handling red roses.

---

One group of dogs was exposed to two different experimental conditions:
- In condition 1, an experimenter who always wore a white coat regularly fed the dogs.
- In condition 2, an experimenter who always wore a black coat prepared the food and got the feed bowls ready, but another experimenter then came in and actually gave the food to the dogs.

The dogs were exposed to these conditions in random order twice daily for ten days. The amount of saliva produced by the dogs each time the experimenter approached was measured and recorded. These results, together with the baseline data that were collected before the experiment began, are shown in the table below.

| Baseline condition (before conditioning) | Experimental condition 1 (white coat) | Experimental condition 2 (black coat) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3.2mL | 6.8mL | 3.5mL |

#### The results in the table show that the dogs demonstrated what?

The dogs demonstrated that they had associated the sight of the experimenter in the white coat with getting food.

In attempting to classically condition an eye-blink response to the sound of a pencil tap, Elke was the experimenter and Peta was the participant. Elke noticed that Peta's conditioned response (CR) (the eye-blink to the pencil tap alone) was becoming stronger as the number of pairing of two the stimuli increased.

#### In this experiment, what stage of classical conditioning was Peta in?

At that point in the experiment Peta was still in the acquisition phase of classical conditioning as the CR was growing in strength over time.

Once the experiment was over, Elke was concerned that Peta might continue to blink every time she heard a pencil tap.

#### Elke made sure this wouldn't happen by presenting the pencil tap alone for some time until she was sure that the stage of what had been achieved.

Elke would make sure that extinction had occurred and that the CR had been successfully extinguished before leaving Peta.

The following week in their Psychology class, Elke accidentally tapped her pencil and noticed that Peta blinked.

#### This suggests that what may have occurred?

The appearance of CR after some amount of time since the CR was believed to have been extinguished suggests that spontaneous recovery may have occurred.

# Learning Activity 11.6

| Name of process | Description of process | Example of process | Key factors influencing the process |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acquisition | The association of an UCS and CS to create a CR by repeated presentations of the UCS and CS together | Playing a buzzer and a administering an electric shock simultaneously | The timing between the presentation of the UCS and CS (should be minimised <1/2 second) |
| Extinction | The gradual decrease in the strength of the CR after the UCS is no longer presented | The lessening levels of salivation in response to the bell in Pavlov's dogs after the meat powder was no longer brought out | The strength of the existing conditioning |
| Spontaneous recovery | The reappearance of the CR after a rest break (when the CS was not presented) when the CR appeared to have been extinguished | Pavlov's dogs salivating in response to a bell the day after an experiment where towards the end the dogs did not salivate in response to the bell | The time since the last exposure of the CS, the strength of the conditioning |

| Stimulus discrimination | A response does not occur when a stimulus similar to the CS is presented | A response does not occur to a knock on a wooden floor when the CS is a knock on a wooden door | The uniqueness of the CS |

# Learning Activity 11.7

#### Explain why Pavlov actually used the term conditioned reflex rather than conditioned response

The actions that are made as a result of classical conditioning appear so natural and automatic that Pavlov referred to them as conditioned reflexes. The responses are in truth reflexes, as they are involuntary actions made by the individual.

---

A person under treatment for a gambling addiction often feels an urge to play the pokies whenever he again encounters cues such as driving past a gambling venue where he experienced a huge 'buzz' after hitting a jackpot, and hearing about someone else's big win on the machines.

#### How may classical conditioning account for acquisition of the conditioned response in the scenario?

During their gambling time, the person associated the gambling venue with the huge 'buzz' (CR) that they would feel when they see someone winning a jackpot, or when winning one themselves. This leads them to still feel urges to visit the venue when driving past (CS).

After swimming in the lake near his home one day, Glen emerged from the water covered with slimy blood-sucking leeches all over his back and legs. He was revolted as he removed the leeches. The next time he swam there, a leech attached itself to his cheek. Now, every time he passes the lake, Glen shudders in disgust.

#### How may classical conditioning account for acquisition of the conditioned response in the scenario?

On the two occasions Glen went swimming in the lake, he associated the lake with the feeling of the blood-sucking leeches on him. Now when driving past the lake (CS), Glen is reminded of the feeling of the leeches again and feels disgusted (CR).

---

When Mardi and her sisters were toddlers, their mother frequently used their nap time to vacuum. Now when Mardi and her sisters hear vacuum cleaners, they feel sleepy.

#### How may classical conditioning account for acquisition of the conditioned response in the scenario?

While toddlers, Mari and her sisters associated the sound of the vacuum cleaner (CS) with the act of falling asleep. This causes them to still feel sleepy (CR) when hearing the sound of the vacuum cleaner.

Every time three-year-old Sienna heard the doorbell ring, she raced to open the front door. On Halloween night, Sienna answered the doorbell and encountered a scary monster that intentionally startled her. Sienna screamed in fear and ran away. Her parents calmed her down but it happened again later that evening. Now Sienna whimpers and hides whenever the doorbell rings.

#### How may classical conditioning account for acquisition of the conditioned response in the scenario?

Sienna associated the sound of the doorbell (CS) with seeing the startling monster. Now when she hears the doorbell she whimpers and hides (CR).

---

A flashing light suddenly appearing on the control panel triggers a burst of adrenaline in a plane pilot.

#### How may classical conditioning account for acquisition of the conditioned response in the scenario?

During the pilots training, they learn to associate the flashing light (CS) with the possibility of danger, causing a rush of adrenaline (CR).

# Learning Activity 11.8

#### To which objects did Albert demonstrate stimulus generalisation?

White rabbit, sealskin coat and a dog.

#### Consider Watson and Rayner's (1920) study from an ethical perspective. To what extent were ethical principles for psychological research applied in the 'Little Albert' experiment? Explain with reference to procedures used by Watson and Rayner.

During the period the study was completed, ethical guidelines were not properly established , and as a result the research was conducted without consultation to a board for ethical consideration. Albert was however screened to be a healthy child, and it was believed that no lasting harm or psychological damage would be imposed on Albert. Other researchers from the time period however claim that Watson and Rayner did not take steps towards ensuring that Albert would not have lasting damage, and it is unclear as to whether informed consent by Albert's mother was given, as well as whether withdrawal rights were able to be executed.

#### Suggest an ethically acceptable procedure involving classical conditioning that could be used to extinguish Albert's fear response to white furry objects. Indicate the CS, UCS, CR and UCR.

UCS: A rub on the belly
UCR: Fondness / happiness from being rubbed on the belly
CS: Presentation of a white furry object
CR: Fondness / happiness

# Learning Activity 11.9

#### Explain the meaning of exposure therapy with reference to the key feature of graduated exposure and that of flooding.

Exposure therapy is a type of behaviour therapy which involves bringing the client into direct contact with the stimulus. When using graduated exposure, stimuli which are progressively more similar to the CS are exposed until the CS itself is presented to the subject. In flooding the client is brought into direct contact with the CS immediately and is exposed to the stimulus until the conditioned response is extinguished.

---

#### Define graduated exposure with reference to an example not use in the text.
#### Construct a hierarchy of frightening situations (such as that for fear of flying in figure 11.15) for someone with one of the following fears: dogs, heights, swimming

** Least frightening **

Photo taken from high up

Standing on a table

Standing on a bridge

Standing on a ladder

Standing on the observation section of the Eiffel Tower

** Most frightening **

---

#### Define flooding with reference to an example not used in the text

Flooding refers to immersing a patient with a stimulus that is potentially frightening to them until the conditioned response is extinguished.

#### Give an example of how flooding might be used to eliminate a conditioned response associated with your choice of fear from dogs, heights or swimming

To eliminate the fear of dogs, a patient could be brought into a room of fluffy dogs and be forced to stay there until hysteria subsides.

---

#### Distinguish between imaginal and in vivo exposure

Imaginal exposure refers to exposure that is visualised within the mind of a patient, whereas in vivo exposure refers to real-world exposure to a stimulus.

---

#### What is aversion therapy?

Aversion therapy is a form of behaviour therapy that applies classical conditioning processes to inhibit or discourage undesirable behaviour by associating it with an aversive stimulus such as a feeling of disgust, pain or nausea.

#### What are two limitations or criticisms of aversion therapy?

- Long term abusers of for example alcohol would return to drinking after they stopped taking the drug which made them feel nauseous.
- The learned aversion often fails to generalise to situations other than those under which the learning took place.

# Learning Activity 11.10

#### Define trial and error learning

Trial and error learning involves trying many alternatives until a desired outcome is achieved.

#### Give an example of trial and error learning in everyday life

Learning to play a new video game without a tutorial level.

#### Mardi tries several new routes to school and eventually discovers the quickest, which she decides to use every day. Explain Mardi's behaviour and discovery with reference to trial and error learning theory

Mardi has a desire to get to school as quick as possible (motivation), and tries out several routes (exploration). Some are slower (incorrect response) and some are quicker (correct response). Eventually she finds a route that was quicker than her old route, meaning she can get to school faster than she previously could (reward).

#### Is 'learning through mistakes' a suitable alternative name for trial and error learning? Explain your answer

Trial and error learning relies on correct responses and incorrect responses being achieved. With solely mistakes, an individual won't properly learn.

#### What are two key differences between classical conditioning and trial and error learning?

- Classical conditioning is unable to explain learning that occurs from intentional experiences as well as learning of complex actions which aren't simply reflexive
- Classical conditioning involves creating an association between two stimuli, whereas in trial and error learning there is only a single stimuli.

# Learning Activity 11.11

#### What is operant conditioning?

Operant conditioning is a learning process in which consequences which follow a response determine whether the behaviour influence will be repeated.

#### Why did Skinner adopt the term operant conditioning rather than instrumental conditioning? In your answer, include a definition of an operant with reference to an example not used in the text.

An operant is any response (or set of responses) that acts ('operates') on the environment to produce some kind of consequence. Examples of an operant may be moving from one room to another, pulling a lever or some other action. Skinner adopted the term operant conditioning as the consequence which leads learning in the animal is dependent on the operant response made.

#### What is the main difference between an antecedent and a consequence in relation to timing?

The antecedent occurs before the operant response whereas the consequence occurs after the operant response.

#### Briefly describe the three-phase model of operant conditioning.

1. Discriminative stimulus
2. Operant response
3. Consequence

---

#### What is a discriminative stimulus?

A discriminative stimulus is a stimulus (object or event) which precedes a particular response.

#### In what way does a discriminative stimulus influence the occurrence of a particular response?

The discriminative stimulus signals the probable consequence and therefore influences the occurrence of the response.

---

Sienna experienced the 'runner's high' (due to endorphin release) when she ran a mini-marathon and as a result has started running 10 kilometres three times a week.

#### Explain Sienna's changed behaviour using the three-phase model of operant conditioning.

- Discriminative stimulus - Advertisement showing the mini-marathon
- Operant response - Participated in mini-marathon
- Consequence - Sienna experienced the 'runner's high'

Consider toddler Alex who is being toilet-trained by her parents using operant conditioning. Her parents wait until after Alex has had a drink and her bladder is full, then put her on a potty seat and wait for nature to take its course. When Alex urinates in the potty, her parents provide a verbal praise ('What a good girl you are, Alex!') or even some stickers that she loves. She is also punished when she has a wetting accident by verbal disapproval ('Mummy is very disappointed in you, Alex'). Gradually, Alex learns enough bladder control to recognise when urination is imminent, and to withhold the response long enough for a quick trip to the potty seat - thus obtaining a reward and avoiding punishment. Eventually the behaviour becomes automatic enough that Alex continues to use the potty seat.

#### Explain Alex's successful toilet training using the three-phase model of operant conditioning. Ensure you refer to each component with reference to the relevant aspect(s) of Alex's toilet training.

- Discriminative stimulus - Feeling of needing to urinate
- Operant response - Urination
- Consequence - Praise by parents

- Discriminative stimulus - Feeling of needing to urinate
- Operant response - No urination
- Consequence - Scolding by parents

# Learning Activity 11.12

#### Briefly outline a procedure for an experiment using a Skinner box to operantly condition a rat to produce a particular response.

To operantly condition a rat to press a button, whenever the button is pressed, food could be dispensed. This provides positive reinforcement for the behaviour, making it more likely to be repeated.

#### Briefly outline a procedure for an experiment using a Skinner box to operantly condition a rat not to produce a particular response.

To operantly condition a rat to avoid walking on a pad in the box, an electric shock could be administered whenever the rat walked over the pad. This provides positive punishment, making it less likely for the behaviour to be repeated.

---

#### In Skinner's view, what are the main driving forces behind behaviour?

Skinner believed that behaviour could be understood in terms of environmental, or external, influences without any consideration of the internal mental processes.

---

#### Identify the operationalised IVs and DVs in Skinner's (1938) experiment with the hungry rat outlined on pages 426-427.

IV - whether the food was provided upon a lever press
DV - the frequency which the lever was pressed

#### Explain the rat's learning through operant conditioning using the three-phase model of conditioning.

- Discriminative stimulus - Being placed in the box
- Operant response - Pressing the lever
- Consequence - Food

# Learning Activity 11.13

#### Define the term reinforcement with reference to an example

Reinforcement refers to a consequence which encourages a operant response to be repeated in the future.

#### Define term terms positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement

Positive reinforcement refers to consequences that encourage behaviour to be repeated in the future by addition of a desirable stimulus.
Negative reinforcement refers to consequences that encourage behaviour to be repeated in the future by removal of a undesirable stimulus.

#### In what way are positive reinforcers and rewards similar and in what way are they different?

?

---

#### What do positive and negative reinforcers have in common in terms of their consequences?

The consequence that occurs will likely lead to the operant response occurring again in the future.

#### Identify three positive and negative reinforcers that you have observed teachers use in the classroom and three that you have observed in other real-life contexts.

- Lollies to students who perform well on tests (positive reinforcement)
- Special stamps to students who perform well on tests (positive reinforcement)
- No pestering for completion of homework once homework is done (negative reinforcement)

#### How are positive and negative reinforcers different?

Positive reinforcers refer to when something pleasant is experienced after the operant response whereas negative reinforcers refer to the removal of an unpleasant stimulus after the operant response.

# Learning Activity 11.14

#### Define the term punishment.

Punishment refers to the delivery of unpleasant consequence following a response which in turn reduces the likelihood of that response being repeated.

#### Explain what punishment involves and why it is used, with reference to an example not used in the text.

An example of punishment may be being yelled at by a lifeguard when running around a pool. This is used to minimise repetition of the behaviour (running around a pool) in the future.

---

#### Distinguish between positive and negative punishment with reference to an example not used in the text.

Positive punishment involves the addition of an unpleasant stimulus whereas negative punishment involves the removal of a pleasant stimulus.

---

#### What is response cost?

Response cost refers to the removal of a valued stimulus.

#### Explain why is is a form of negative punishment with reference to an example not used in the text.

The valued stimulus is often a pleasant stimulus, removal of the stimulus therefore disincentivises the behaviour, leading to negative punishment.

#### Does response cost always involve something of monetary value? Explain.

Response cost is not always some monetary value, it can be for example the grade on a school assignment. The grade is desired by the student and losing it presents discouragement.

---

#### How does punishment differ from negative reinforcement? Explain with reference to an example.

Punishment discourages repetition of a particular behaviour whereas negative reinforcement encourages repetition of behaviour by removing an unpleasant stimulus.

#### How does punishment differ from extinction? Explain with reference to an example.

?

#### Describe three key factors involved in effective punishment.

- Order of presentation
- Timing
- Appropriateness

---

#### Describe a situation in which a punisher might reinforce a behaviour rather than weaken it or reduce its frequency.

A child wanting attention in class may increase their talking back to a teacher when yelled at as they are getting attention even though the yelling by the teacher was intended to decrease the amount of talking back.

#### Describe a situation where an effective punisher could reduce the incidence of behaviour recurring.

When a policeman catches a youth speeding after being getting their provisional license they may lose their license for 3 months. This would decrease the likelihood of the youth speeding in the future.

---

#### Describe three ways in which punishment may be used ineffectively.

- A punishment may not be appropriate
- The timing of a punishment may not be effective
- The order of the punishment and the behaviour may not be effective

#### Suggest practices other than punishment that could be used by a parent to deal with a child who persistently engages in one of the following behaviours: teasing, swearing, keeping their bedroom messy, being late home.

A parent could give their child a chocolate each time they clean their room, this is positive reinforcement.

---

#### What was Skinner's view on the use of punishment in everyday life?

Skinner believed that positive reinforcement should be used where possible in place of punishment to encourage a change in behaviour.
