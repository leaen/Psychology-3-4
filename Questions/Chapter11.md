# Learning Activity 11.2

#### What observation led Pavlov to study classical conditioning?

Pavlov observed how dogs fed meat powder would begin to salivate when Pavlov approached them before actually presented with the meat powder.

#### Define classical conditioning and briefly describe how it occurs, without referring to any 'technical' terms.

Classical conditioning refers to a type of learning that occurs through the repeated association of two (or more) different stimuli.

#### In what way(s) did restraining the dogs in Pavlov's experiments help to control the potential confounding variables?

The dog would not look at other objects in the room (including the researchers).

---

#### Define and explain the role of each of the different kinds of stimuli and responses in classical conditioning: UCS, UCR, CS, CR

UCS: The original stimulus that produces a response
UCR: The original (involuntary) response to the UCS
CS: The conditioned stimulus that produces a response after conditioning occurs
CR: The conditioned (involuntary) response to the CS

#### Which of the stimuli is originally a neutral stimulus?

The CS is initially a neutral stimulus.

#### Why is it called a neutral stimulus?

The CS is called a neutral stimulus because it causes no response from the organism before acquisition.

#### Explain the relationship between the neutral stimulus and the conditioned stimulus in classical conditioning.

The CS and UCS are repeatedly exposed together, eventually causing both the UCS and CS to trigger a response.

---

#### At what point in the process of classical conditioning can it be said that a response has been learned?

A response is said to have been learnt when the CS alone reliably produces a CR that was not previously present.

# Learning Activity 11.3

#### Scenario 1

- UCS: Cyclone Tracey
- CS: The bathroom
- UCR: Hiding in bathroom to protect themselves from the Cyclone
- CR: Fearing bathrooms

#### Scenario 2

- UCS: Witnessing the planes crash into the WTC
- CS: The sight or sound of low-flying planes
- UCR: Shock and terror from seeing 9/11
- CR: Anxiety and nervousness

#### Scenario 3

- UCS: An electric shock
- CS: The sound of a buzzer
- UCR: The movement of the participants hand in response to the electric shock
- CR: The movement of the participants hand in response to the buzzer

# Learning Activity 11.4

#### Explain the meaning of the term acquisition in relation to classical conditioning

Acquisition is the overall process during which an organism learns to associate two events.

#### What is being acquired?

The association between the UCS and the CS is being acquired.

#### How is it acquired?

The association is acquired through repeated presentations of the UCS and CS together.

#### Describe the relationship between timing and acquisition.

The less time elapsed between the presentation of the UCS and the CS the more effective the conditioning is.

---

#### What does extinction mean in classical conditioning?

Extinction is the gradual decrease in the strength of a CR that occurs when the UCS is no longer presented.

#### When is extinction evident in classical conditioning?

After the repeated presentations of the UCS and CS together stop.

---

#### What does spontaneous recovery mean in classical conditioning?

Spontaneous recovery is the reappearance of a CR after a rest break when it appeared to have been extinguished.

#### When is spontaneous recovery evident in classical conditioning?

Spontaneous recovery is evident in classical conditioning after a rest break.

---

#### What is the key difference between spontaneous recovery and extinction? Explain with reference to an example not used in the text.

Extinction refers to the gradual decrease in the strength of the CR after the UCS is no longer presented whereas spontaneous recovery refers to the reappearance of the CR after a rest break when it appeared to have been extinguished.

#### Explain the meaning of the terms stimulus discrimination and stimulus generalisation in relation to classical conditioning. Refer to an example from everyday life, but not one used in the text.

Stimulus generalisation occurs when an organism responds to stimuli that are similar to the CS but not the same. For example the CS may be a knock on a door but an organism may still respond to a knock on the floor.

Stimulus discrimination occurs when an organism responds only to its CS. For example it may respond to its CS (a clap) but not to a similar sound (a hi5).

# Learning Activity 11.5

When she was about eight years old, Elizabeth decided to help her mother at the florist's store where her mother worked. She first helped on Valentine's Day. Elizabeth did such a good job bringing in all the red roses for her mother to arrange that she was paid $20. But at the end of the day, nearly every finger on Elizabeth's hands was bleeding  because of the thorns on the red roses. On Mother's Day that year, Elizabeth worked at the florist's store again. Although she earned another $20, her hands were again very sore at the end of the day from the thorns on the red roses.

The following week when her mother asked Elizabeth to assist with preparing flowers for a large wedding, Elizabeth replied that she would help as long as there were no red flowers involved.

#### Elizabeth's refusal to handle red flowers is an example of what?

Elizabeth was conditioned to feel nervous around handling red flowers as she on two separate occasions injured her hands when handling red roses, this is an example of stimulus generalisation.

One group of dogs was exposed to two different experimental conditions:
- In condition 1, an experimenter who always wore a white coat regularly fed the dogs.
- In condition 2, an experimenter who always wore a black coat prepared the food and got the feed bowls ready, but another experimenter then came in and actually gave the food to the dogs.

The dogs were exposed to these conditions in random order twice daily for ten days. The amount of saliva produced by the dogs each time the experimenter approached was measured and recorded. These results, together with the baseline data that were collected before the experiment began, are shown in the table below.

| Baseline condition (before conditioning) | Experimental condition 1 (white coat) | Experimental condition 2 (black coat) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3.2mL | 6.8mL | 3.5mL |

#### The results in the table show that the dogs demonstrated what?

The dogs demonstrated that they had associated the sight of the experimenter in the white coat with getting food.

---

In attempting to classically condition an eye-blink response to the sound of a pencil tap, Elke was the experimenter and Peta was the participant. Elke noticed that Peta's conditioned response (CR) (the eye-blink to the pencil tap alone) was becoming stronger as the number of pairing of two the stimuli increased.

#### In this experiment, what stage of classical conditioning was Peta in?

At that point in the experiment Peta was still in the acquisition phase of classical conditioning as the CR was growing in strength over time.

Once the experiment was over, Elke was concerned that Peta might continue to blink every time she heard a pencil tap.

#### Elke made sure this wouldn't happen by presenting the pencil tap alone for some time until she was sure that the stage of what had been achieved.

Elke would make sure that extinction had occurred and that the CR had been successfully extinguished before leaving Peta.

The following week in their Psychology class, Elke accidentally tapped her pencil and noticed that Peta blinked.

#### This suggests that what may have occurred?

The appearance of CR after some amount of time since the CR was believed to have been extinguished suggests that spontaneous recovery may have occurred.

# Learning Activity 11.6

| Name of process | Description of process | Example of process | Key factors influencing the process |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acquisition | The association of an UCS and CS to create a CR by repeated presentations of the UCS and CS together | Playing a buzzer and a administering an electric shock simultaneously | The timing between the presentation of the UCS and CS (should be minimised <1/2 second) |
| Extinction | The gradual decrease in the strength of the CR after the UCS is no longer presented | The lessening levels of salivation in response to the bell in Pavlov's dogs after the meat powder was no longer brought out | The strength of the existing conditioning |
| Spontaneous recovery | The reappearance of the CR after a rest break (when the CS was not presented) when the CR appeared to have been extinguished | Pavlov's dogs salivating in response to a bell the day after an experiment where towards the end the dogs did not salivate in response to the bell | The time since the last exposure of the CS, the strength of the conditioning |
| Stimulus generalisation | A response occurs when a stimulus similar to the CS is presented | A response occurs to a knock on a wooden floor when the CS is a knock on a wooden door | The uniqueness of the CS |
| Stimulus discrimination | A response does not occur when a stimulus similar to the CS is presented | A response does not occur to a knock on a wooden floor when the CS is a knock on a wooden door | The uniqueness of the CS |

# Learning Activity 11.7

#### Explain why Pavlov actually used the term conditioned reflex rather than conditioned response

The response of salivation made by the dogs is in truth a reflex, hence conditioned reflex.

A person under treatment for a gambling addiction often feels an urge to play the pokies whenever he again encounters cues such as driving past a gambling venue where he experienced a huge 'buzz' after hitting a jackpot, and hearing about someone else's big win on the machines.

#### How may classical conditioning account for acquisition of the conditioned response in the scenario?

During their gambling time, the person associated the gambling venue with the huge 'buzz' (CR) that they would feel when they see someone winning a jackpot, or when winning one themselves. This leads them to still feel urges to visit the venue when driving past (CS).

After swimming in the lake near his home one day, Glen emerged from the water covered with slimy blood-sucking leeches all over his back and legs. He was revolted as he removed the leeches. The next time he swam there, a leech attached itself to his cheek. Now, every time he passes the lake, Glen shudders in disgust.

#### How may classical conditioning account for acquisition of the conditioned response in the scenario?

On the two occasions Glen went swimming in the lake, he associated the lake with the feeling of the blood-sucking leeches (UCS) on him (disgusting - UCR). Now when driving past the lake (CS), Glen is reminded of the leeches again and feels disgusted (CR).

---

When Mardi and her sisters were toddlers, their mother frequently used their nap time to vacuum. Now when Mardi and her sisters hear vacuum cleaners, they feel sleepy.

#### How may classical conditioning account for acquisition of the conditioned response in the scenario?

While toddlers, Mari and her sisters associated the sound of the vacuum cleaner (CS) with the feeling of sleepiness (UCS) and the act of falling asleep (UCR). This causes them to still feel sleepy (CR) when hearing the sound of the vacuum cleaner.

Every time three-year-old Sienna heard the doorbell ring, she raced to open the front door. On Halloween night, Sienna answered the doorbell and encountered a scary monster that intentionally startled her. Sienna screamed in fear and ran away. Her parents calmed her down but it happened again later that evening. Now Sienna whimpers and hides whenever the doorbell rings.

#### How may classical conditioning account for acquisition of the conditioned response in the scenario?

Sienna associated the sound of the doorbell (CS) with seeing the startling monster (UCS) which terrified her (UCR). Now when she hears the doorbell she whimpers and hides (CR).

---

A flashing light suddenly appearing on the control panel triggers a burst of adrenaline in a plane pilot.

#### How may classical conditioning account for acquisition of the conditioned response in the scenario?

During the pilots training, they learn to associate the flashing light (CS) with the possibility of danger (UCS), causing a rush of adrenaline (CR).

# Learning Activity 11.8

#### To which objects did Albert demonstrate stimulus generalisation?

White rabbit, sealskin coat and a dog.

#### Consider Watson and Rayner's (1920) study from an ethical perspective. To what extent were ethical principles for psychological research applied in the 'Little Albert' experiment? Explain with reference to procedures used by Watson and Rayner.

During the period the study was completed, ethical guidelines were not properly established, and as a result the research was conducted without consultation to a board for ethical consideration. Albert was however screened to be a healthy child, and it was believed that no lasting harm or psychological damage would be imposed on Albert. Other researchers from the time period however claim that Watson and Rayner did not take steps towards ensuring that Albert would not have lasting damage, and it is unclear as to whether informed consent by Albert's mother was given, as well as whether withdrawal rights were able to be executed.

#### Suggest an ethically acceptable procedure involving classical conditioning that could be used to extinguish Albert's fear response to white furry objects. Indicate the CS, UCS, CR and UCR.

The procedure of counter-conditioning could be used to quell Albert's fear.

UCS: A rub on the belly
UCR: Fondness / happiness from being rubbed on the belly
CS: Presentation of a white furry object
CR: Fondness / happiness

# Learning Activity 11.9

#### Explain the meaning of exposure therapy with reference to the key feature of graduated exposure and that of flooding.

Exposure therapy is a type of behaviour therapy which involves bringing the client into direct contact with the stimulus. When using graduated exposure, stimuli which are progressively more similar to the CS are exposed until the CS itself is presented to the subject. In flooding the client is brought into direct contact with the CS immediately and is exposed to the stimulus until the conditioned response is extinguished.

---

#### Define graduated exposure with reference to an example not used in the text.


Graduated exposure involves presenting successive approximations of a fear-inducing stimulus until the stimulus can be presented without inducing anxiety or fear.

#### Construct a hierarchy of frightening situations (such as that for fear of flying in figure 11.15) for someone with one of the following fears: dogs, heights, swimming

** Least frightening **

Photo taken from high up

Standing on a table

Standing on a bridge

Standing on a ladder

Standing on the observation section of the Eiffel Tower

** Most frightening **

---

#### Define flooding with reference to an example not used in the text

Flooding refers to immersing a patient with a stimulus that is potentially frightening to them until the conditioned response is extinguished.

#### Give an example of how flooding might be used to eliminate a conditioned response associated with your choice of fear from dogs, heights or swimming

To eliminate the fear of dogs, a patient could be brought into a room of fluffy dogs and be forced to stay there until hysteria subsides.

---

#### Distinguish between imaginal and in vivo exposure

Imaginal exposure refers to exposure that is visualised within the mind of a patient, whereas in vivo exposure refers to real-world exposure to a stimulus.

---

#### What is aversion therapy?

Aversion therapy is a form of behaviour therapy that applies classical conditioning processes to inhibit or discourage undesirable behaviour by associating it with an aversive stimulus such as a feeling of disgust, pain or nausea.

#### What are two limitations or criticisms of aversion therapy?

- Long term abusers of for example alcohol would return to drinking after they stopped taking the drug which made them feel nauseous.
- The learned aversion often fails to generalise to situations other than those under which the learning took place.

# Learning Activity 11.10

#### Define trial and error learning

Trial and error learning involves trying many alternatives until a desired outcome is achieved.

#### Give an example of trial and error learning in everyday life

Learning to play a new video game without a tutorial level.

#### Mardi tries several new routes to school and eventually discovers the quickest, which she decides to use every day. Explain Mardi's behaviour and discovery with reference to trial and error learning theory

Mardi has a desire to get to school as quick as possible (motivation), and tries out several routes (exploration). Some are slower (incorrect response) and some are quicker (correct response). Eventually she finds a route that was quicker than her old route, meaning she can get to school faster than she previously could (reward).

#### Is 'learning through mistakes' a suitable alternative name for trial and error learning? Explain your answer

Trial and error learning relies on correct responses and incorrect responses being achieved. With solely mistakes, an individual won't properly learn.

#### What are two key differences between classical conditioning and trial and error learning?

- Classical conditioning is unable to explain learning that occurs from intentional experiences as well as learning of complex actions which aren't simply reflexive
- Trial and error learning is not a passive process like classic conditioning is

# Learning Activity 11.11

#### What is operant conditioning?

Operant conditioning is a learning process in which consequences which follow a response determine whether the behaviour is likely to be repeated.

#### Why did Skinner adopt the term operant conditioning rather than instrumental conditioning? In your answer, include a definition of an operant with reference to an example not used in the text.

An operant is any response (or set of responses) that acts ('operates') on the environment to produce some kind of consequence. Examples of an operant may be moving from one room to another, pulling a lever or some other action. Skinner adopted the term operant conditioning as the consequence which leads learning in the animal is dependent on the operant response made.

#### What is the main difference between an antecedent and a consequence in relation to timing?

The antecedent occurs before the operant response whereas the consequence occurs after the operant response.

#### Briefly describe the three-phase model of operant conditioning.

1. Discriminative stimulus
2. Operant response
3. Consequence

---

#### What is a discriminative stimulus?

A discriminative stimulus is a stimulus (object or event) which precedes a particular response, signals the probable consequence for the response and therefore influences the occurrence of the response.

#### In what way does a discriminative stimulus influence the occurrence of a particular response?

The discriminative stimulus signals the probable consequence and therefore influences the occurrence of the response.

The antecedent cues for the response to occur.

Sienna experienced the 'runner's high' (due to endorphin release) when she ran a mini-marathon and as a result has started running 10 kilometres three times a week.

#### Explain Sienna's changed behaviour using the three-phase model of operant conditioning.

- Discriminative stimulus - Running a mini-marathon
- Operant response - Experiencing 'runner's high' due to endorphin release
- Consequence - Sienna feels good and is motivated
- Effect on future behaviour - Sienna increases the frequency at which she goes for a run

Consider toddler Alex who is being toilet-trained by her parents using operant conditioning. Her parents wait until after Alex has had a drink and her bladder is full, then put her on a potty seat and wait for nature to take its course. When Alex urinates in the potty, her parents provide a verbal praise ('What a good girl you are, Alex!') or even some stickers that she loves. She is also punished when she has a wetting accident by verbal disapproval ('Mummy is very disappointed in you, Alex'). Gradually, Alex learns enough bladder control to recognise when urination is imminent, and to withhold the response long enough for a quick trip to the potty seat - thus obtaining a reward and avoiding punishment. Eventually the behaviour becomes automatic enough that Alex continues to use the potty seat.

#### Explain Alex's successful toilet training using the three-phase model of operant conditioning. Ensure you refer to each component with reference to the relevant aspect(s) of Alex's toilet training.

- Discriminative stimulus - Feeling of needing to urinate
- Operant response - Urination
- Consequence - Praise by parents
- Effect on future behaviour - (Positive reinforcement) More likely to use the toilet

- Discriminative stimulus - Feeling of needing to urinate
- Operant response - No urination or wetting accident
- Consequence - Scolding by parents
- Effect on future behaviour - (Positive punishment) More likely to use the toilet

# Learning Activity 11.12

#### Briefly outline a procedure for an experiment using a Skinner box to operantly condition a rat to produce a particular response.

To operantly condition a rat to press a button, whenever the button is pressed, food could be dispensed. This provides positive reinforcement for the behaviour, making it more likely to be repeated.

#### Briefly outline a procedure for an experiment using a Skinner box to operantly condition a rat not to produce a particular response.

To operantly condition a rat to avoid walking on a pad in the box, an electric shock could be administered whenever the rat walked over the pad. This provides positive punishment, making it less likely for the behaviour to be repeated.

---

#### In Skinner's view, what are the main driving forces behind behaviour?

Skinner believed that behaviour could be understood in terms of environmental, or external, influences without any consideration of the internal mental processes. Specifically, that behaviour can be explained by the stimuli that come before and after historical behaviour.

---

#### Identify the operationalised IVs and DVs in Skinner's (1938) experiment with the hungry rat outlined on pages 426-427.

IV - whether the food was provided upon a lever press
DV - the frequency which the lever was pressed

#### Explain the rat's learning through operant conditioning using the three-phase model of conditioning.

- Discriminative stimulus - Being placed in the box
- Operant response - Pressing the lever
- Consequence - Food

# Learning Activity 11.13

#### Define the term reinforcement with reference to an example

Reinforcement refers to a consequence which encourages a operant response to be repeated in the future.

#### Define term terms positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement

Positive reinforcement refers to consequences that encourage behaviour to be repeated in the future by addition of a desirable stimulus.
Negative reinforcement refers to consequences that encourage behaviour to be repeated in the future by removal of a undesirable stimulus.

#### In what way are reinforcers and rewards similar and in what way are they different?

- Reinforcers strengthen behaviour regardless of whether the organism experiences pleasure or satisfaction whereas a reward will generally always involve a pleasant experience
- Both can have satisfying consequences
- Both can lead to the strengthening of a response

---

#### What do positive and negative reinforcers have in common in terms of their consequences?

The consequence that occurs will likely lead to the operant response occurring again in the future.

#### Identify three positive and negative reinforcers that you have observed teachers use in the classroom and three that you have observed in other real-life contexts.

- Lollies to students who perform well on tests (positive reinforcement)
- Special stamps to students who perform well on tests (positive reinforcement)
- No pestering for completion of homework once homework is done (negative reinforcement)

#### How are positive and negative reinforcers different?

Positive reinforcers refer to when something pleasant is experienced after the operant response whereas negative reinforcers refer to the removal of an unpleasant stimulus after the operant response.

# Learning Activity 11.14

#### Define the term punishment.

Punishment refers to the delivery of unpleasant consequence following a response which in turn reduces the likelihood of that response being repeated.

#### Explain what punishment involves and why it is used, with reference to an example not used in the text.

An example of punishment may be being yelled at by a lifeguard when running around a pool. This is used to minimise repetition of the behaviour (running around a pool) in the future.

---

#### Distinguish between positive and negative punishment with reference to an example not used in the text.

Positive punishment involves the addition of an unpleasant stimulus whereas negative punishment involves the removal of a pleasant stimulus.

---

#### What is response cost?

Response cost refers to the removal of a valued stimulus.

#### Explain why is is a form of negative punishment with reference to an example not used in the text.

The valued stimulus is often a pleasant stimulus, removal of the stimulus therefore disincentivises the behaviour, leading to negative punishment.

#### Does response cost always involve something of monetary value? Explain.

Response cost is not always some monetary value, it can be for example the grade on a school assignment. The grade is desired by the student and losing it presents discouragement.

---

#### How does punishment differ from negative reinforcement? Explain with reference to an example.

Punishment discourages repetition of a particular behaviour whereas negative reinforcement encourages repetition of behaviour by removing an unpleasant stimulus.

#### How does punishment differ from extinction? Explain with reference to an example.

A punishment refers to the decrease in the likelihood of a behaviour as a result of discouragement whereas extinction refers to the decrease in the likelihood of a behaviour as a result of a lack of reinforcement that may have been previously given.

#### Describe three key factors involved in effective punishment.

- Order of presentation
- Timing
- Appropriateness

---

#### Describe a situation in which a punisher might reinforce a behaviour rather than weaken it or reduce its frequency.

A child wanting attention in class may increase their talking back to a teacher when yelled at as they are getting attention even though the yelling by the teacher was intended to decrease the amount of talking back.

#### Describe a situation where an effective punisher could reduce the incidence of behaviour recurring.

When a policeman catches a youth speeding after being getting their provisional license they may lose their license for 3 months. This would decrease the likelihood of the youth speeding in the future.

---

#### Describe three ways in which punishment may be used ineffectively.

- A punishment may not be appropriate
- The timing of a punishment may not be effective
- The order of the punishment and the behaviour may not be effective

#### Suggest practices other than punishment that could be used by a parent to deal with a child who persistently engages in one of the following behaviours: teasing, swearing, keeping their bedroom messy, being late home.

A parent could give their child a chocolate each time they clean their room, this is positive reinforcement.

---

#### What was Skinner's view on the use of punishment in everyday life?

Skinner believed that positive reinforcement should be used where possible in place of punishment to encourage a change in behaviour.

# Learning Activity 11.15

Identify the operant conditioning process that is being illustrated in each of the following examples. Choose from positive reinforcement (PR), negative reinforcement (NR), positive punishment (PP), and negative punishment (NP).

#### Write the initials of the correct responses in the space below.

1. Positive reinforcement
2. Negative reinforcement
3. Positive punishment
4. Positive punishment
5. Negative reinforcement
6. Positive punishment
7. Negative punishment

# Learning Activity 11.16

| Concept | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Positive reinforcement | The addition of a pleasant stimulus leading to increased likelihood of a behaviour being repeated | Giving a student a lolly as a reward for scoring a high mark |
| Negative reinforcement | The removal of an unpleasant stimulus leading to increased likelihood of a behaviour being repeated | Giving a child chocolate to stop them from screaming |
| Positive punishment | The addition of an unpleasant stimulus leading to decreased likelihood of a behaviour being repeated | Giving someone an electric shock when pressing a button |
| Negative punishment | The removal of a pleasant stimulus leading to decreased likelihood of a behaviour being repeated | Having your phone taken away after spending too much time on Facebook |
| Response cost | The removal or loss of a valued stimulus | Being fined for speeding |

# Learning Activity 11.17

#### What does the term schedule of reinforcement refer to?

A schedule of reinforcement is a program that dictates the frequency and way in which reinforcement is given for a desired response.

---

#### Distinguish between continuous and partial reinforcement with reference to a relevant example in a laboratory setting.

Continuous reinforcement is the process of giving reinforcement whenever a correct response occurs, e.g giving a rat food pellets whenever they press a button. Partial reinforcement is the process of reinforcing some correct responses but not all of them. For example giving a pigeon food pellets every fifth time it pecks a button.

#### Give two examples of continuous and partial reinforcement in everyday life.

| Partial reinforcement | Continuous reinforcement |
| --- | --- |
| Giving a dog a treat every third time it completes a trick. | A primary school student getting a gold star for each book they read |
| Slot machines giving a payout after a random number of spins | Commission based sales |


#### Which is more effective in strengthening a response once it has been acquired: continuous or partial reinforcement? Explain your answer with reference to research findings.

Partial reinforcement is more likely to strengthen a response once it occurs consistently. This was first observed by Skinner (1956) who found that after rats had been trained to press a button, when only reinforced some of the time, they were found to be less likely to undergo extinction.

#### When in the operant conditioning process is it most advantageous to use continuous reinforcement?

During the initial acquirement, earlier on in the conditioning process.

---

#### Construct a table in which you summarise and distinguish between the four basic schedules of reinforcement. Include two examples of each schedule in your table.

| Schedule of reinforcement | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fixed ratio | Reinforcement given after a set and known number of responses | A loyalty card where you receive a free burger for every 5 burgers you buy |
| Fixed interval | Reinforcement given after a set and known amount of time | A parent always checks their child's room on a Sunday to see if it's clean, a weekly pay cheque, a student is allowed to watch TV after completing 90 minutes of homework |
| Variable ratio | Reinforcement given after a changing and unknown number of responses | Slot machines |
| Variable interval | Reinforcement given after a changing and unknown amount of time | Facebook notifications, staying 'on hold' when calling phone support |

---

#### What are some possible effects of a long delay in the presentation of a reinforcer?

Extinction or reduced likelihood of a correct response could occur.

#### At what stage of the learning process should a reinforcer be presented to be most effective? Explain your answer.

The reinforcer should only be presented after a desired or correct response is made so as to ensure that the correct behaviour is reinforced.

#### How might the use of an inappropriate reinforcer affect the learning process?

If an inappropriate reinforcer is used it may have the reverse effect on the learner and instead decrease the likelihood of a correct response being shown in the future.

A toddler cries in the middle of the night. A parent wakes and responds by bringing the toddler into the parent's bed. The parent would prefer the toddler to sleep in her own bedroom but the toddler continues crying unless moved to the parent's room.

#### Explain, with reference to the three-phase model, how this situation may have developed.

Each time the toddler has cried in the past he has been taken into his parents room and been given attention. They have then associated waking and the response of crying with being given attention by their parents (a pleasurable stimulus). Waking up in the middle of the night is the antecedent, crying is the behaviour and the parents coming to comfort is the consequence.

#### Describe a reinforcement strategy the parent could use to change the unwanted behaviour of their toddler.

- Do not reinforce the child when it screams out in the middle of the night
- Reinforce the child when it successfully sleeps a full night in its own bed

---

Refer to the learning curves produced by four different schedules of reinforcement, as shown in figure 11.33.

#### Do the curves indicate continuous or partial reinforcement? Explain your answer.

The curves are all for partial reinforcement.

#### Which schedule of reinforcement is the most effective for the quickest acquisition of a desired response. Which is least effective? Explain each answer with reference to relevant curves and theory on the schedules.

- Fixed ratio for most effective acquisition
- Variable interval for least effective acquisition

#### Assuming the graph shows the learning curves of four different pigeons reinforced for pecking responses, suggest which pigeon's behaviour will be most resistant to extinction (cessation or elimination) and which pigeon's behaviour will be least resistant. Explain each answer.

- Variable ratio is most resistant to extinction
- Fixed interval is least resistant to extinction

#### Explain the role of a discriminative stimulus in stimulus discrimination

The discriminative stimulus is the stimulus that is intended to produce a response.

---

Which of the following scenarios involve stimulus generalisation? Which involve stimulus discrimination?

#### Lauren asks Gino out on a date but he declines. Lauren decides that she won't ask another boy out again.

Stimulus generalisation

#### Toula is paid for doing chores around the home and expects to be paid for doing chores at her aunty's place when she stays there.

Stimulus generalisation

#### Jackson is scared of the sound of a lawnmower but not the sound of an electric toothbrush.

Stimulus discrimination

#### Sam is scared of the sound of his dad's electric drill. When his dad stops using the drill Sam relaxes. Sam's dad then reaches for the electric saw. As soon as Sam sees this, he is scared and runs inside.

Mr Ying is a young, handsome Psychology teacher who has just been appointed to a girl's college. Unfortunately his Psychology class is so distracted by his appearance that they find it difficult to focus on their work and on his instructions. There is a lot of giggling, whispering and a general lack of attention. Mr Ying is determined to make a good impression with his classroom control and with his teaching methods. He decides to use detention as a means of pulling the girls' behaviour into line. He runs a lunchtime detention for six girls whose behaviour has been the worst. In the next class, not only do these six girls misbehave, but they are joined at the next detention by four others. This trend continues until almost the entire class is on detention.

#### Which operant conditioning process is Mr Ying trying to use to change the girls' behaviour?

Positive punishment.

#### Provide a description of its effectiveness and an explanation as to why this is so.

The punishment is ineffective as a lunchtime detention simply provides the students more time to look at Mr Ying and is therefore inappropriate.

#### How could Mr Ying change his strategy with the girls and still use operant conditioning?

Have a less attractive teacher run the detention sessions.

Maria had enjoyed attending the same P-12 college for ten years. Quite suddenly this year, her friendship group drifted away from her. She is now being bullied by some other girls because she has become a 'loner'. After an unsuccessful attempt to solve her problems by speaking with her year-level coordinator, Maria started to take days off school, telling her mother she wasn't feeling well. Her absenteeism increased. Although she was concerned about missing school, she couldn't face the unpleasant actions of the bullies.

#### Which operant conditioning process explains the increase in Maria's behaviour of deceiving her mother and staying home from school? Explain how this process worked in Maria's situation.

Maria was negatively reinforced when skipping school as she would not have to face the bullies and therefore avoided an unpleasant experience.

#### Which operant conditioning process describes the consequence of the bullying behaviour for Maria? Explain its effect on Maria's attendance behaviour.

Maria was positively punished when attending school as she would have to face the bullies and therefore experience an unpleasant stimulus.

# Learning Activity 11.20

#### Define the term shaping

Shaping involves the reinforcement of progressive approximations of a desired behaviour.

#### Under what circumstances would shaping be used to promote learning?

Shaping is used to promote the learning of complex behaviour that would not occur normally and therefore cannot be reinforced.

#### Give an example of when you have used shaping to modify either a person's or an animal's behaviour and describe the shaping procedure used.

Giving treats when a dog puts its paw up in the air when training it to shake hands.

#### What is a token economy? Explain with reference to key operant conditioning principles and processes.

A token economy involves the use of reinforcers that can be exchanged for other reinforcers.

#### Under what circumstances might the use of a token economy be ineffective?

A token economy may not be effective as they do not always change the underlying cause of a behaviour. They may also be ineffective when the learner feels manipulated.

Throughout his career, Skinner proposed numerous applications of operant conditioning. For example, during World War II, he developed the idea of 'Project Pigeon'. This was a secret project in which he conditioned pigeons to guide missiles towards an enemy target. The birds were placed in the nose of a missile, harnessed in front of a screen on which the moving image of a target flashed. When the missile was in flight, the pigeons would peck the moving image, which produced corrective signals that would keep the missile on course. The US Department of Defense determined that pigeons could play an effective role, but they were never used in actual warfare because the development of electronic missile guidance systems made it unnecessary.

#### Suggest how shaping may have been used to train the pigeon to be comfortable within the confines of a missile nose and to peck at the correct target on a screen to keep the missile on the required flight path.

The pigeon may have been reinforced when first pecking the screen in any spot, then within a certain margin to the target and then when on the target.

**Increase the number of people who use public transport**

The public transport commission could begin to fine those who use cars to get to work. The non-discriminative stimulus is the need to get to work, the behaviour is driving a car and the consequence is receiving a fine. This is a form of response cost (negative punishment) as the learner loses money.

**Increase the number of people who use a car-pooling arrangement to travel to and from work**

A workplace may provide free or cheap secure parking to those who register as car-pooling. The non-discriminative stimulus is driving.

#### What is the purpose of baseline data?

The purpose of baseline data is to ensure that there is a way to compare the results of the experiment to what is considered 'normal' and therefore be able to tell whether a change in behaviour has occurred.

#### Explain the difficulties experienced by the teacher with reference to three operant conditioning principles.

The teacher did not provide reinforcement to those who chose to act in an appropriate manner.

The teacher would not give out appropriate punishments, he punished the whole class instead of particular students, perhaps leading more students to talk out of line since they believe they would be kept in anyway.

The teacher never went through on his threats (e.g detention) and therefore the students never associated a consequence with the act of talking during class time.

#### Make two suggestions involving operant conditioning principles to help the teacher overcome the difficulties with his class.

When the students come into class and spend the first 40 minutes of class time working hard and focusing, the teacher could give them free time for the remaining 10 minutes of the period. This associates the classroom, with the behaviour of working hard, with the consequence of free time. This positive reinforcement will increase the likelihood of the children continuing to focus during class time.

When students come into class and after settling down continue to talk and act rudely then they will be handed out yard duty detentions. This associates the classroom, with the act of talking during class, with the consequence of a detention. This response cost of losing their valued lunchtime will decrease the likelihood of them repeating their behaviour of talking during class.

# Learning Activity 11.22b

#### What is the operationalised independent variable?

Whether or not the girl was provided with praise when interacting with her peers instead of adults.

#### On which days was the 'control' condition conducted? What was the purpose of this?

Day 1 and 3, in order to provide baseline measurements to which the experimental condition can be compared to.

#### Identify the key elements of operant conditioning evident in this scenario.

The girl was positively reinforced when she chose to interact with other children while at preschool. This increased the likelihood that she would continue to do interact with them instead of interacting with adults.

#### In which condition was the young girl's interaction with other children at its lowest? At its highest? What do these data tell you about the success or failure of the program devised by the team of psychologists and undertaken by the teachers?

Initially her interaction with children is at its lowest since the girl has been provided no incentive to interact with her peers. It is highest during acquisition as the praise is continually given to the girl. The result suggest that the program was successful in increasing the proportion of the time spent interacting with other children compared to adults as the normal rate of interaction was quadrupled in the experimented condition (~15% compared to ~60%).

#### Why did the teachers stop using praise with the young girl for a time and then recommence its use?

To test whether the increased interaction with children was due to the praise being given or other factors.

# Learning Activity 11.25

Consider each of the following scenarios and state whether the behaviour that is described is best explained by classical conditioning, operant conditioning or a combination of both these types of learning. Give a reason for each answer.

#### Sally cries whenever she hears a barking dog. Before this, Sally had reached out to pat a stray dog and the dog barked and bit her hand. The next time Sally tried to pat the dog, it barked and bit her hand.

Classical conditioning

Sally experiences an involuntary response when she sees a dog.
She has associated the sound of hearing a dog barking with her hand being bitten.

UCS - Barking and biting dog

UCR - Crying in response to having her hand bitten

NS - Hearing a dog barking

CS - Hearing a dog barking

CR - Crying in response to hearing the dog barking

#### Hamish's ex-girlfriend always wore a musk perfume. Hamish still cringes whenever he comes across someone wearing musk perfume.

Classical conditioning

Hamish experiences an involuntary feeling of cringe when smelling musk perfume as he has associated that smell with his ex-girlfriend.

UCS - His ex-girlfiend

UCR - Feeling cringe in response to his ex-girlfriend

NS - Musk perfume

CS - Musk perfume

CR - Feeling cringe in response to the smell of musk perfume

#### A father refuses to let his daughter borrow his car after she has 'borrowed' it previously and returned it with a near-empty petrol tank.

Operant conditioning

The father associated his daughter taking his car out with the stimulus of having a near-empty petrol tank. This provided negative punishment (response cost) and decreased the likelihood of him wanting to let his daughter take his car out again in the future.

Antecedent - Daughter asking the dad if she can borrow his car

Behaviour - Dad letting daughter borrow his car

Consequence - Having a near-empty petrol tank when she comes back

#### Emilia arrives home on time after having been grounded for being home late the last time she went out with her friends.

Operant conditioning

Having previously been grounded for coming home late (response cost) Emilia decided not to repeat her behaviour from the week before.

Antecedent - ?

Behaviour - Coming home late after going out

Consequence - Being grounded for a week

#### Define observational learning with reference to an example

Observational learning occurs when someones behaviour is guided by the result of watching someone else's behaviour. An example of observational learning is watching someone else playing pong and then being able to play pong yourself.

#### Why is observational learning also referred to as modelling?

Observational learning occurs by the learner watching a model. As a result of watching the model's behaviour, the learner's behaviour is guided to mold the set of actions made by the model.

#### What are two key assumptions of Bandura's social learning theory?

- The learner is attentive and focuses on the behaviour and its consequences
- The learner saves a mental representation of the behaviour
- The learner has the physical and intellectual ability able to complete the behaviour
- The learner motivated to reproduce the behaviour
- The learner believes that reinforcement will be arise from completing the behaviour

#### What does vicarious conditioning involve when observing a model?

Vicarious conditioning involves watching a model be either reinforced or punished for producing a certain behaviour. This leads the learner to then perform the behaviour in the same way, a modified way or avoid performing the behaviour altogether depending on the consequences observed after the model performs the behaviour.

#### Distinguish between a live model and a symbolic model with reference to relevant examples

A live model is someone in the flesh in front of the learner performing an action whereas a symbolic model may be a fictional or real person portrayed in a movie, TV show or book. An example of a live model may be a parent chopping up vegetables at dinner. An example of a symbolic model may be watching a man on TV get hit by a car after jay walking.

#### Describe three different responses you probably learned through observational learning. Try to think of a variety of behaviours; for example, actions, cognitions or emotions ranging from relatively simple to more complex. For each response, what model did you observe, what did you observe and how similar were you responses to theirs.

I've learnt particular details of form in completing freestyle by watching videos of other athletes completing in freestyle races. I then formed a mental representation of the correct actions. I've known I'm able to complete that actions and want to. I've then gone on to reproduce that same behaviour and be reinforced by swimming better times.

I've learnt to make pancakes by watching my mother make them. I store a mental representation of the necessary ingredients and steps to make the batter and how to cook them. I'm old enough to be able to use the pan and stove. I'm hungry so I'll make the pancakes and be reinforced by satisfying my hunger.

I've learnt how to paint by watching videos of Bob Ross painting. I store a mental representation of the actions necessary to create a painting, and am able to reproduce it. When I want to, I'll knock out a painting that is likely to then reinforce me by receiving compliments on my artwork.

#### Give two examples of learned behaviours that are not acquired through observational learning. Explain your choice of examples.

Learning not to touch hot objects. After having touched many hot objects (e.g soldering irons, pans, ovens) I have associated the stimulus of something hot with pain via CC.

Learning to complete homework. After choosing to increase the amount of homework I complete each day I was reinforced by seeing my grades rise in my subjects.

# Learning Activity 11.28

#### Distinguish between learning and performance. Explain with reference to an example not use in the text.

Learning refers to gaining the ability to produce a behaviour whereas performance refers to actual completion of an action. You may learn how to play downball by watching your friends play but you until you take part in the game you have not performed the behaviour, and only have a stored representation of it.

#### What is the role of the learner in observational learning?

The role of the learner is to watch and think about the actions made by the model and then understand the consequences and whether they themselves should reproduce the behaviour.

#### Describe and explain each of the processes of observational learning with reference to an example not used in the text.

The following table lays out the example of a competitive swimmer learning to swim butterfly by watching videos of Michael Phelps

| Step | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The learner is attentive and focuses on the behaviour and its consequences | The swimmer watches how Michael moves his arms underwater and how he kicks his legs The swimmer also sees that Michael places first in almost all of his races |
| 2 | The learner saves a mental representation of the behaviour | The swimmer can visualise how Michael's body moves through the water and where his hands move at the start and end of each stroke |
| 3 | The learner has the physical and intellectual ability able to complete the behaviour | The swimmer trains in the gym often and is smart enough to spot key details in the form of the stroke |
| 4 | The learner motivated to reproduce the behaviour | The swimmer wants to get faster themselves |
| 5 | The learner believes that reinforcement will be arise from completing the behaviour | The swimmer knows that if they swim like Michael Phelps they will beat all of their friends |

#### Explain, with reference to its processes, why observational learning is referred to as a form of cognitive learning.

Observational learning requires much more cognitive processing to understand the details of the behaviour being made by a model and the consequences that follow. During the first process in observational learning, the learner watches closely and focuses on the behaviour being made by the model, this requires the cognitive process of attention. During retention the learner requires the usage of memory another cognitive process. The learner also is guided to either repeat or avoid the behaviour by vicarious reinforcement, a learning process. Since observational learning encompasses both cognitive and learning attributes, it is said to be a form of cognitive learning.

Many people believe that violent behaviour is learnt by observing violence in television programs, movies and other media, and/or through playing violent computer games.

#### What does research evidence suggest about such learning?

Research suggests that people can learn from watching violent movies and playing computer games in methodology laid out by the stages of observational learning. The learning is still subject to the requirements of observational learning however, in that the individual must be motivated to learn the behaviours, and therefore would be predisposed to act violent even in the absence of such media.

#### What other variables may impact on observational learning of violence?

The upbringing that a particular child is exposed to may lead them to be more or less comfortable with violent behaviour. If domestic abuse frequently occurred within their home, the child may also tend to act violent toward other children. The amount at which the violent behaviour is learnt from video games also depends on how much the child can relate to the character within the game, for example when playing a game where space aliens box on kangaroos, the child is unlikely to identify with the character and reproduce the behaviour.


# Learning Activity 11.30

#### Construct a research hypothesis that could have been tested in the experiment

Children who see an adult act charitably tend to also act charitably regardless of what the adult says compared to children who see an adult act selfishly.

#### Identify the operationalised variables

The particular group a child was placed into, one of the following

1. Model preached charity and behaved charitably
2. Model preached charity but behaved selfishly
3. Model preached selfishness and behaved selfishly
4. Model preached selfishness but behaved charitably

#### Name the experimental design

Independent groups

#### Explain whether the results support the hypothesis

The hypothesis is support as both conditions where the adult acted charitably saw much higher rates of charitable behaviour in comparison to the conditions in which the adult acted selfishly.

#### Are the results consistent with Bandura's observational learning theory? Explain your answer

The results are consistent in that the children repeated the actions that the adults made and not what the adults claimed was best.
