#### What observation led Pavlov to study classical conditioning?

The salivation of dogs to meat powder.

#### Define classical conditioning and briefly describe how it occurs, without referring to any 'technical' terms.

Classical conditioning refers to a type of learning that occurs through the repeated association of two (or more) different stimuli.

#### In what way(s) did restraining the dogs in Pavlov's experiments help to control the potential confounding variables?

The dog would not look at other objects in the room (including the researchers).

---

#### Define and explain the role of each of the different kinds of stimuli and responses in classical conditioning: UCS, UCR, CS, CR

UCS: The original stimulus that produces a response
UCR: The original (involuntary) response to the UCS
CS: The conditioned stimulus that produces a response after conditioning occurs
CR: The conditioned (involuntary) response to the CS

#### Which of the stimuli is originally a neutral stimulus?

The CS is initially a neutral stimulus.

#### Why is it called a neutral stimulus?

The CS is called a neutral stimulus because it causes no response from the organism.

#### Explain the relationship between the neutral stimulus and the conditioned stimulus in classical conditioning.

The CS and UCS are repeatedly exposed together, eventually causing both the UCS and CS to trigger a response.

---

#### At what point in the process of classical conditioning can it be said that a response has been learned?

A response is said to have been learnt when the CS reliably produces a CR that was not previously present.

#### Scenario 1

- UCS: Cyclone Tracey
- CS: The bathroom
- UCR: Hiding in bathroom to protect themselves from the Cyclone
- CR: Fearing bathrooms

#### Scenario 2

- UCS: 9/11
- CS: The sight or sound of low-flying planes
- UCR: Witnessing the planes crash into the WTC
- CR: Anxiety and nervousness

#### Scenario 3

- UCS: An electric shock
- CS: The sound of a buzzer
- UCR: The movement of the participants hand
- CR: The movement of the participants hand

# Learning Activity 11.4

#### Explain the meaning of the term acquisition in relation to classical conditioning

Acquisition is the overall process during which an organism learns to associate two events.

#### What is being acquired?

The association between the UCS and the CS is being acquired.

#### How is it acquired?

The association is acquired through repeated presentations of the UCS and CS together.

#### Describe the relationship between timing and acquisition.

The less time elapsed between the presentation of the UCS and the CS the more effective the conditioning is.

---

#### What does extinction mean in classical conditioning?

Extinction is the gradual decrease in the strength of a CR that occurs when the UCS is no longer presented.

#### When is extinction evident in classical conditioning?

After the repeated presentations of the UCS and CS together stop.

---

#### What does spontaneous recovery mean in classical conditioning?

Spontaneous recovery is the reappearance of a CR after a rest break when it appeared to have been extinguished.

#### When is spontaneous recovery evident in classical conditioning?

Spontaneous recovery is evident in classical conditioning after a rest break.

---

#### What is the key difference between spontaneous recovery and extinction? Explain with reference to an example not used in the text.

Extinction refers to the gradual decrease in the strength of the CR after the UCS is no longer presented whereas spontaneous recovery refers to the reappearance of the CR after a rest break when it appeared to have been extinguished.

#### Explain the meaning of the terms stimulus discrimination and stimulus generalisation in relation to classical conditioning. Refer to an example from everyday life, but not one used in the text.

Stimulus generalisation occurs when an organism responds to stimuli that are similar to the CS but not the same. For example the CS may be a knock on a door but an organism may still respond to a knock on the floor.

Stimulus discrimination occurs when an organism responds only to its CS. For example it may respond to its CS (a clap) but not to a similar sound (a hi5).

# Learning Activity 11.5

When she was about eight years old, Elizabeth decided to help her mother at the florist's store where her mother worked. She first helped on Valentine's Day. Elizabeth did such a good job bringing in all the red roses for her mother to arrange that she was paid $20. But at the end of the day, nearly every finger on Elizabeth's hands was bleeding  because of the thorns on the red roses. On Mother's Day that year, Elizabeth worked at the florist's store again. Although she earned another $20, her hands were again very sore at the end of the day from the thorns on the red roses.

The following week when her mother asked Elizabeth to assist with preparing flowers for a large wedding, Elizabeth replied that she would help as long as there were no red flowers involved.

#### Elizabeth's refusal to handle red flowers is an example of what?

Elizabeth was conditioned to feel nervous around handling red flowers as she on two separate occasions injured her hands when handling red roses.

One group of dogs was exposed to two different experimental conditions:
- In condition 1, an experimenter who always wore a white coat regularly fed the dogs.
- In condition 2, an experimenter who always wore a black coat prepared the food and got the feed bowls ready, but another experimenter then came in and actually gave the food to the dogs.

The dogs were exposed to these conditions in random order twice daily for ten days. The amount of saliva produced by the dogs each time the experimenter approached was measured and recorded. These results, together with the baseline data that were collected before the experiment began, are shown in the table below.

| Baseline condition (before conditioning) | Experimental condition 1 (white coat) | Experimental condition 2 (black coat) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3.2mL | 6.8mL | 3.5mL |

#### The results in the table show that the dogs demonstrated what?

The dogs demonstrated that they had associated the sight of the experimenter in the white coat with getting food.

In attempting to classically condition an eye-blink response to the sound of a pencil tap, Elke was the experimenter and Peta was the participant. Elke noticed that Peta's conditioned response (CR) (the eye-blink to the pencil tap alone) was becoming stronger as the number of pairing of two the stimuli increased.

#### In this experiment, what stage of classical conditioning was Peta in?

At that point in the experiment Peta was still in the acquisition phase of classical conditioning as the CR was growing in strength over time.

Once the experiment was over, Elke was concerned that Peta might continue to blink every time she heard a pencil tap.

#### Elke made sure this wouldn't happen by presenting the pencil tap alone for some time until she was sure that the stage of what had been achieved.

Elke would make sure that extinction had occurred and that the CR had been successfully extinguished before leaving Peta.

The following week in their Psychology class, Elke accidentally tapped her pencil and noticed that Peta blinked.

#### This suggests that what may have occurred?

The appearance of CR after some amount of time since the CR was believed to have been extinguished suggests that spontaneous recovery may have occurred.
