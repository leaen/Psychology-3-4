#### Distinguish between stress, stressors and the stress response with reference to a scenario not used in the text.

Stress is a state of psychological and physiological arousal produced by internal or external stressors that are perceived by the individual and challenging or exceeding their ability or resources to cope. A stressor is an object, person or situation that leads produces stress. A stress response is a reaction that involves the physiological and psychological changes people experience when confronted with a stressor.

#### When is a stressor likely to be described as chronic?

A stressor can be described as chronic when an individual must face this stressor over an extended period or time or they are unable to otherwise manage it.

#### Explain the relationship between stress, stressors and the stress response with reference to a scenario not used in the text.

A wall street trader may have entered a trade and see that he is losing money (stressor), this leads him to enter a psychological and physiological state of unease as he may feel he is unable to cope with the situation (stress). This in turn increases his heart-rate and dilate his pupils (stress response) as he prepares to hedge his position.

---

Consider the different classifications of stressors.

#### Give an example of an internally sourced stressor that is not psychological.

- Fatigue
- Chronic pain
- Fever
- Physical injury

#### Give an example of how a physical stimulus may be a stressor.

A man jumping out with a baseball bat at night may be stressful and/or intimidating.

---

#### What is the fight-flight response?

The fight-flight response is an involuntary physiological response that prepares an individual to fight a threat or flee from a physically or psychologically threatening situation.

#### What type of stimulus and/or stressor other than a threat can initiate the response?

The fight or flight response can be initiated by a psychological or physical stimulus.

For example:
- Sight of a spider (physical)
- Worrying about an exam (psychological)

#### Describe a fight-flight response you have experience and any physiological change you were aware of and any you were unlikely to be aware of. Refer to the text and figure 13.3 when outlining changes.

When frightened by a spider I have felt my heart-rate increase but would not have felt my pupils dilate.

#### Explain why the fight-flight response cannot be consciously controlled.

The fight-flight response is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, which is not consciously regulated.

---

#### What is the HPA axis?

The HPA axis is a chain of physiological reactions involving the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and the adrenal cortex/glands.

#### Outline the key physiological changes involved in the HPA axis

- The hypothalamus is activated upon seeing a threat
- The hypothalamus activates the pituitary gland
- The pituitary gland releases ACTH
- ACTH travels through the blood to the adrenal cortex
- The adrenal cortex secretes cortisol
- Cortisol raises the energy levels within the body

#### When is the HPA axis likely to be initiated?

When an individual is experiencing chronic stress.

---

#### What 'stress hormones' are released during the fight-flight response?

Adrenaline and noradrenaline

#### What 'stress hormones' are released if the fight-flight stimulus persists?

Cortisol

---

#### Explain the role of the adrenal glands in physiological responses to stress.

The adrenal glands regulate the amount of adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol released into the blood.

---

A research study measuring the effectiveness of a stress reduction course used cortisol level as their dependent variable.

#### Is cortisol a valid dependent variable for this study?

Yes

#### If the stress reduction was effective, what would happen to the participants' cortisol levels?

The levels of cortisol would reduce

---

You are a passenger in a car when the driver suddenly slam on the breaks to avoid hitting a dog. Outline and explain the physiological changes likely to occur during:

#### the first 30 seconds

Jump in adrenaline and noradrenaline, increase in cortisol

#### after about 20 minutes

Little to no adrenaline or noradrenaline left, decrease in cortisol down to normal levels

# Learning Activity 13.3

#### Distinguish between eustress and distress

Eustress is a positive psychological state whereas distress is a negative psychological state

#### Describe two characteristics of eustress and two of distress

Eustress is typically short-term and involves feeling enthusiastic and active whereas distress involves negative psychological states such as angry, anxiety and tension as well as arising from a negative response to a stressor.

---

#### Outline three events and/or situations that could cause eustress in one person and distress in another. Explain why the different responses can occur.

A rollercoaster may give someone who enjoys going on rides eustress but someone who is afraid of heights distress.

Fans of horror films may experience eustress after a jump scare but those who are easily frightened may experience distress.

Different responses occur as a result of the differing interpretations of a situation and whether someone can properly cope with them. The past experiences that people have also lead them to react differently in the same scenario.
