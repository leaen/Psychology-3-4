#### Distinguish between stress, stressors and the stress response with reference to a scenario not used in the text.

Stress is a state of psychological and physiological arousal produced by internal or external stressors that are perceived by the individual and challenging or exceeding their ability or resources to cope. A stressor is an object, person or situation that leads produces stress. A stress response is a reaction that involves the physiological and psychological changes people experience when confronted with a stressor.

#### When is a stressor likely to be described as chronic?

A stressor can be described as chronic when an individual must face this stressor over an extended period or time or they are unable to otherwise manage it.

#### Explain the relationship between stress, stressors and the stress response with reference to a scenario not used in the text.

A wall street trader may have entered a trade and see that he is losing money (stressor), this leads him to enter a psychological and physiological state of unease as he may feel he is unable to cope with the situation (stress). This in turn increases his heart-rate and dilate his pupils (stress response) as he prepares to hedge his position.

---

Consider the different classifications of stressors.

#### Give an example of an internally sourced stressor that is not psychological.

- Fatigue
- Chronic pain
- Fever
- Physical injury

#### Give an example of how a physical stimulus may be a stressor.

A man jumping out with a baseball bat at night may be stressful and/or intimidating.

---

#### What is the fight-flight response?

The fight-flight response is an involuntary physiological response that prepares an individual to fight a threat or flee from a physically or psychologically threatening situation.

#### What type of stimulus and/or stressor other than a threat can initiate the response?

The fight or flight response can be initiated by a psychological or physical stimulus.

For example:
- Sight of a spider (physical)
- Worrying about an exam (psychological)

#### Describe a fight-flight response you have experience and any physiological change you were aware of and any you were unlikely to be aware of. Refer to the text and figure 13.3 when outlining changes.

When frightened by a spider I have felt my heart-rate increase but would not have felt my pupils dilate.

#### Explain why the fight-flight response cannot be consciously controlled.

The fight-flight response is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, which is not consciously regulated.

---

#### What is the HPA axis?

The HPA axis is a chain of physiological reactions involving the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and the adrenal cortex/glands.

#### Outline the key physiological changes involved in the HPA axis

- The hypothalamus is activated upon seeing a threat
- The hypothalamus activates the pituitary gland
- The pituitary gland releases ACTH
- ACTH travels through the blood to the adrenal cortex
- The adrenal cortex secretes cortisol
- Cortisol raises the energy levels within the body

#### When is the HPA axis likely to be initiated?

When an individual is experiencing chronic stress.

---

#### What 'stress hormones' are released during the fight-flight response?

Adrenaline and noradrenaline

#### What 'stress hormones' are released if the fight-flight stimulus persists?

Cortisol

---

#### Explain the role of the adrenal glands in physiological responses to stress.

The adrenal glands regulate the amount of adrenaline, noradrenaline and cortisol released into the blood.

---

A research study measuring the effectiveness of a stress reduction course used cortisol level as their dependent variable.

#### Is cortisol a valid dependent variable for this study?

Yes

#### If the stress reduction was effective, what would happen to the participants' cortisol levels?

The levels of cortisol would reduce

---

You are a passenger in a car when the driver suddenly slam on the breaks to avoid hitting a dog. Outline and explain the physiological changes likely to occur during:

#### the first 30 seconds

Jump in adrenaline and noradrenaline, increase in cortisol

#### after about 20 minutes

Little to no adrenaline or noradrenaline left, decrease in cortisol down to normal levels

# Learning Activity 13.3

#### Distinguish between eustress and distress

Eustress is a positive psychological state whereas distress is a negative psychological state

#### Describe two characteristics of eustress and two of distress

Eustress is typically short-term and involves feeling enthusiastic and active whereas distress involves negative psychological states such as angry, anxiety and tension as well as arising from a negative response to a stressor.

---

#### Outline three events and/or situations that could cause eustress in one person and distress in another. Explain why the different responses can occur.

A rollercoaster may give someone who enjoys going on rides eustress but someone who is afraid of heights distress.

Fans of horror films may experience eustress after a jump scare but those who are easily frightened may experience distress.

Different responses occur as a result of the differing interpretations of a situation and whether someone can properly cope with them. The past experiences that people have also lead them to react differently in the same scenario.

# Learning Activity 13.4

#### Explain the meaning of the phrase 'psychological response to stress'

A psychological response to stress refers to the emotional, cognitive and behavioural changes that occur as a result of stress.

#### In what three ways can psychological responses to stress be distinguished from physiological responses to stress?

- They are not directly observable

---

| Type of change | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Emotional | Changes that occur in feelings. Individual's may report feeling anxious, tense, angry, irritable or helpless. These feelings are often accompanied by a negative attitude toward oneself. |
| Cognitive | Changes that occur in an individual's mental abilities. For example difficulty concentrating, making decisions, and being more forgetful |
| Behavioural | Changes that occur in how someone cats, talks, dresses. Changes in sleep patterns or extraversion |

---

#### Give an example of how prior experience may influence a psychological response to stress.

Someone who has been on a lot of carnival rides may be less scared to go on a rollercoaster than someone who has never been on a rollercoaster before. The person with more experience would therefore experience a lesser stress response than the first-timer.

#### Suggest how an individual's personal interpretation of a stressor may impact on their stress response

A grandmaster playing chess may recognise a particularly strong move made by an opponent during a chess game whereas a rookie may not realise the significance of it. The stress response would therefore be more significant in the grandmaster than the rookie due to differing interpretations of the situation.

# Learning Activity 13.6

#### Explain the meaning of the phrase 'psychological determinants of the stress response' with reference to an example and explain how psychological and physiological determinants differ.

Psychological determinants of the stress responses are psychological factors that have an influence on the human stress response. Some of these factors include attitudes, coping skills, prior experiences with stressors and stress responses.

For example if someone doubts their knowledge in a subject they may feel stressed about an upcoming test.

#### Briefly describe Lazarus and Folkman's transactional model of stress and coping.

The Lazarus and Folkman transactional model of stress and coping proposes that stress involves an encounter ('transaction') between an individual and their external environment, and that a stress response depends upon the individual's interpretation ('appraisal') of the stressor and their ability to cope with it.

#### What role does the environment play in stress?

?

#### What role does the individual play in stress?

?

---

#### What does appraisal involve?

Appraisal involves the judging of a situation.

#### Name and describe the two major types of appraisal, according to Lazarus and Folkman.

Primary appraisal

- The initial appraisal
- Involves deciding whether the stimulus is a threat and relevant to us

Secondary appraisal

- Occurs after the primary appraisal
- Involves evaluation of coping options and resources

#### What is the role of reappraisal and when might it occur?

Involves with appraising the situation while taking into account the coping strategies and resources that are made available to the individual.

---

#### Name and describe the three types of appraisals that follow an appraisal of a stimulus as stressful

Harm/loss
Threat
Challenge

---

#### Explain the meaning of coping in relation to a stress response.

Coping is the process of 'constantly changing cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage specific internal and/or external stressors that are appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources of the person'.

#### Name and describe the two types of coping with reference to three examples of each type

Emotional-focused coping which targets on dealing with the stressor without actually taking steps to remove it. Example strategies include wishful thinking, ignoring the stressor and talking to a friend about how you feel.


Problem-focused coping on the other hand targets the stressor itself and how an individual can lessen its burden. Example strategies include studying for a test so you feel like stressed about it, doing mock interviews to prepare for a job interview and performing a oral speech in the mirror.

---

For each of the following statements, name the type of coping strategy that is being used to manage the effects of a stressor

#### I talk to someone about how I feel

Emotional-focused coping

#### I try to come up with a strategy about what to do

Problem-focused coping

#### I look for something good in what is happening

Emotional-focused coping

#### I focus on my school work to take my mind off things

Problem-focused coping

#### I let my feelings out

Emotional-focused coping

#### I learn to live with it

Emotional-focused coping

A friend is experiencing a stress response after submitting a SAC for two VCE subjects in the morning. Shortly after, he learns that a SAC test will be held in five days for a third subject and will therefore clash with a 700-word SAC essay for a fourth subject, which must be submitted on the same day.

#### Describe a problem-focused strategy or strategies that you believe could be effective for managing your friend's stress response.

The friend could focus on writing the 700-word essay and memorising it for two days, then work on revising for the surprise SAC.

---

#### Outline the main strengths and limitations of the transactional model of stress and coping

| Strengths of the transactional model of stress | Limitations of the transactional model of stress |
| --- | --- |
| Takes into account that two people may appraise the same situation differently | Difficult to empirically research |
| Focuses on the psychological determinants of stress which we have control over | Primary and secondary appraisals may overlap |
| Proposes different methods for managing psychological responses to stressors | Individuals may not always be cognitively aware of what is causing them stress |

# Learning Activity 13.9

#### Explain, with reference to an example, how lifestyle change and cultural change can either exacerbate or alleviate the stress response.

When moving to a new country individual's may find it stressful adapting to the new types of food and customs in that country. For example a student moving from China to America for university may be overwhelmed with the amount of fast food and loud people in America.

---

#### Explain how crowding can exacerbate the stress response

When an individual feels uncomfortable with the people around them being so close (e.g. someone sitting next to them on an otherwise empty bus) then their stress response may be exacerbated.

#### Explain how crowding could alleviate the stress response

?

---

#### Briefly describe the relationship between social, cultural and environmental factors and explain why factors from each domain are difficult to isolate and study independently.

?

---

#### Explain, with reference to an example, how social, cultural and environmental factors can interact to influence the stress response.
