# Learning Activity 6.1

#### Can you think of any activity you do that does not depend on memory? If so, give an example.

I cannot think of an activity which does not require some sort of memory.

#### Do you believe that you could learn if you couldn't remember? Could you remember if you couldn't learn? Briefly explain each of your answers.

Memory is a prerequisite to learning. Learning has an implication of a skill progressing, and for that skill to progress, you must be able to recall the lessons completed. As a result, while you cannot learn without memory, you can remember without learning under the condition that learning has occured at some point, otherwise there would be nothing to remember.

#### Suggest an explanation of why we don't remember everything that happens in our lives.

The brain selectively chooses which memories are going to aid survival, and as a result discards memories that are unlikely to help us protect ourselves, find a mate, etc. The brain also cannot physically store all the memories of everything that occurs in our lives.

# Learning Activity 6.2

#### How is memory commonly defined in psychology?

Memory is defined at the stored representations of information.

---

#### Describe the processes of encoding, storage and retrieval

Encoding is the process of converting information into a storable form. Storage is then the storing of information in the brain. Retrieval is then getting access to that information from the memory.

#### Explain the interrelationship between these processes with reference to an example

Information from the outside world or internal thoughts is first converted into a storable form via *encoding*. Then the representation of that information in put into *storage*. Finally, when the information is wanted, the brain accesses the relevent representation via *retrieval*.

#### Explain whether memory is possible without any one of these processes

Complete and proper functioning of memory is not achievable without the fully cooperation of all of these processes. In the case where encoding is disrupted, there is no mechanism for creating new memories. In the case where storage is disrupted, new memories that are in a storable form have nowhere to be maintained, and are subsequently nullified. In the case where retrieval is disrupted, any stored memories are inacessible, leading to a lack of any memory.

#### Explain why comparing human memory to information-processing by a computer may misrepresent or oversimplify human memory

Computers store memory in a very rigourous manner that is highly redundant whereas human memories tend to be much more malleable and may change as they are *representations of information* as opposed to the information itself.

# Learning Activity 6.3

#### Explain the meaning of the term model of memory

Memory being a complicated and difficult to understand topic is simplified into clearer steps and ideas in what is known as a model of memory.

#### Briefly describe the Atkinson-Shriffin multi-store model of memory

Information is first encoded into sensory memory. If a sensation is paid attention, it's then encoded into short-term memory. If elaborative rehersal occurs it is then encoded into long-term memory.

---

#### Distinguish between structual features and control processes in memory, with reference to examples

TODO

#### Explain whether each of the following is a structual feature of control process:
| Deciding whether retrieved information is correct | Control process |
| A neural representation of a memory | Structual feature |
| Encoding | Control process |

# Learning Activity 6.4

#### Construct a research hypothesis that could have been tested by the procedures used in the experiment.

Iconic memory has a virtually unlimited capacity that is persistent for approximately 0.3 seconds.

#### State the operationalised IV(s) and DV(s).

Delay before querying participants to recall information.
Retainment of information as measured by accuracy of recall.

#### Name the experimental design.

Repeated measures.

#### Briefly state the results obtained.

Participants reported seeing more of the projected letters although failed to name them all. When a sound was used to indicate which row to recall, participants were able to recall the relevant row accurately 75% of the time.

---

#### If the results were shown to be statistically significant with p ≤ 0.05, what would this mean?

The probability that the difference in accuracy of recall between the groups was due to random chance alone was less than 5 in 100.

#### Would the results be more meaningful with p ≤ 0.01? Explain your answer.

The probability that the difference in accuracy of recall between the groups was due to random chance alone would be less than 1 in 100 as opposed to 5 in 100 for p ≤ 0.05.

---

#### Briefly state a conclusion based on the results obtained.

It can be concluded that for a split-second, participants had a virtually unlimited capacity of memory. The longer the delay between exposure and recall, the less participants were able to recall, suggesting a memory duration of approximately 0.2 - 0.4 seconds.

#### Comment on the extent to which the results can be generalised.

An experiment that showed statistically signifcant results was completed. Assuming a sample representative of the general population was used, the results may be generalised.

# Learning Activity 6.5

#### What is sensory memory?

Sensory memory is the entry point of memory where new incoming memory is stored for a very brief period.

#### Distinguish between the terms sensory memory sensory register

The term sensory register refers to the memory storage for a particular sense whereas sensory memory refers to the collective memory from all sensory registers.

#### Why can sensory memory be described as a memory system or sub-system rather than a perceptual system?

Information in sensory memory is stored in the relevant organs and not in the brain. As a result of this the information cannot be processed or interpreted, making perception unachievable.

---

#### Define iconic memory and echoic memory with reference to examples that help clarify the definitions.

Iconic memory refers to visual memory such as what you see. Echoic memory is auditory memory such as sounds you can hear.

#### Describe the main distinguishing characteristics of iconic and echoic memory. Refer to the type of sensory information and the storage duration.

Iconic memory stores visual information whereas echoic memory stores auditory information. Iconic memory typically is retained for 0.3 seconds whereas echoic memory is typically retained for 4 seconds.

---

#### In what way might sensory memory have an adaptive function and assist us in adjusting to ongoing environmental change?

The lingering of iconic memory allows for images to be blurred together and allows for more holistic processing of scenes. Similarly, the duration of echoic memory allows for interpretation of speech as sounds are combined together.

#### Is information in sensory memory subject to an encoding process? Explain your answer.

No, as the information is held in the sensory receptor and not encoded until reaching STM.

---

#### What is required for information to transfer from sensory memory to STM?

For information in sensory memory to transfer into STM the information needs to be paid attention.

#### What happens to information that is not transferred to STM?

Information in sensory memory not paid attention to is filtered out of consciousness.

# Learning Activity 6.6

#### Define short-term memory (STM)

Short-term memory (STM) is a memory system with limited storage capcity in which information is stored for a relatively short time, unless renewed in some way.

---

#### What is the storage capacity of STM?

7 ± 2 items

#### Give an example of experimental research that could be conducted to test the capcity of STM

A researcher could ask a participant to listen to a list of words, and then ask them to recall as many as they can.

---

#### What is the storage duration of STM?

12 - 30 seconds, typically 20 seconds.

#### Give an example of experimental research that could be conducted to test the storage duration of STM

A researcher could ask a participant to listen to a list of words, and then ask them to recall as many as they can after progressively longer delays.

---

#### In what ways is STM like sensory memory and unlike sensory memory?

Both STM and sensory memory have very limited storage durations (both in the seconds) however sensory memory has an unlimited capacity compared to the 7 ± 2 items that storable within STM.

---

#### Distinguish between sensory memory and short-term memory with reference to conscious awareness.

Information in sensory memory is not consciously accessible until it is paid attention to and subsequently transferred into short-term memory where you are consciously aware of it.

#### Explain why STM can be described as the 'seat of consciousness' but neither sensory memory nor LTM can be described in this way.

Information stored in sensory memory and LTM is not accessible directly to be consciously thought about, this ability is limited to the STM.

---

#### Explain why STM is described as working memory.

STM is where all cognition and conscious processing of information occurs, in other words the 'working' desk for the brain.

#### In your opinion, is 'short-term memory' or 'working memory' the more appropriate term to describe the memory system that receives information from both sensory memory and LTM? Explain your answer.

Working memory is a more appropriate term as it indicates the important role the particular memory system plays in processing and cognition.

---

#### Describe two ways in which information is frequently lost from STM

Information is most often lost from STM as a result of decay or displacement. Decay occurs over time as information is not rehersed, typically after 20 seconds. Displacement occurs when information is 'pushed out' of STM by new information.

---

You walk from one room to another to pick something up, and when you arrive you have forgotten why you went to the room. You realise that you were thinking about something else and this made you forget the reason for being in the room.

#### Explain why this forgetting occurred in terms of the STM capcity and duration

By the time you would have walked from one room to another, 20 seconds may have passed and decay may have resulted in the memory of the purpose for you going to the room being filtered out of consciousness. Additionally, while walking to the room you may have passed other stimuli that might have entered short-term memory, displacing the purpose for your walk to the room.
