# Learning Activity 6.1

#### Can you think of any activity you do that does not depend on memory? If so, give an example.

I cannot think of an activity which does not require some sort of memory.

#### Do you believe that you could learn if you couldn't remember? Could you remember if you couldn't learn? Briefly explain each of your answers.

Memory is a prerequisite to learning. Learning has an implication of a skill progressing, and for that skill to progress, you must be able to recall the lessons completed. As a result, while you cannot learn without memory, you can remember without learning under the condition that learning has occured at some point, otherwise there would be nothing to remember.

#### Suggest an explanation of why we don't remember everything that happens in our lives.

The brain selectively chooses which memories are going to aid survival, and as a result discards memories that are unlikely to help us protect ourselves, find a mate, etc. The brain also cannot physically store all the memories of everything that occurs in our lives.

# Learning Activity 6.2

#### How is memory commonly defined in psychology?

Memory is defined at the stored representations of information.

#### Describe the processes of encoding, storage and retrieval

Encoding is the process of converting information into a storable form. Storage is then the storing of information in the brain. Retrieval is then getting access to that information from the memory.

#### Explain the interrelationship between these processes with reference to an example

Information from the outside world or internal thoughts is first converted into a storable form via *encoding*. Then the representation of that information in put into *storage*. Finally, when the information is wanted, the brain accesses the relevent representation via *retrieval*.

#### Explain whether memory is possible without any one of these processes

Complete and proper functioning of memory is not achievable without the fully cooperation of all of these processes. In the case where encoding is disrupted, there is no mechanism for creating new memories. In the case where storage is disrupted, new memories that are in a storable form have nowhere to be maintained, and are subsequently nullified. In the case where retrieval is disrupted, any stored memories are inacessible, leading to a lack of any memory.

#### Explain why comparing human memory to information-processing by a computer may misrepresent or oversimplify human memory

Computers store memory in a very rigourous manner that is highly redundant whereas human memories tend to be much more malleable and may change as they are *representations of information* as opposed to the information itself.
