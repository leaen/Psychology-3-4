# Learning Activity 6.1

#### Can you think of any activity you do that does not depend on memory? If so, give an example.

I cannot think of an activity which does not require some sort of memory.

#### Do you believe that you could learn if you couldn't remember? Could you remember if you couldn't learn? Briefly explain each of your answers.

Memory is a prerequisite to learning. Learning has an implication of a skill progressing, and for that skill to progress, you must be able to recall the lessons completed. As a result, while you cannot learn without memory, you can remember without learning under the condition that learning has occured at some point, otherwise there would be nothing to remember.

#### Suggest an explanation of why we don't remember everything that happens in our lives.

The brain selectively chooses which memories are going to aid survival, and as a result discards memories that are unlikely to help us protect ourselves, find a mate, etc. The brain also cannot physically store all the memories of everything that occurs in our lives.
