# Learning Activity 6.1

#### Can you think of any activity you do that does not depend on memory? If so, give an example.

Involuntary reflexes and physiological responses which are under the control of the autonomic system do not depend on memory.

#### Do you believe that you could learn if you couldn't remember? Could you remember if you couldn't learn? Briefly explain each of your answers.

Memory is a prerequisite to learning. Learning has an implication of a skill progressing, and for that skill to progress, you must be able to recall the lessons completed. As a result, while you cannot learn without memory, you can remember without learning under the condition that learning has occured at some point, otherwise there would be nothing to remember.

#### Suggest an explanation of why we don't remember everything that happens in our lives.

The brain selectively chooses which memories are going to aid survival, and as a result discards memories that are unlikely to help us protect ourselves, find a mate, etc. The brain also cannot physically store all the memories of everything that occurs in our lives.

Theories of forgetting like decay theory, motivated forgetting and retrival failure explain the causes of why we tend to forget things.

# Learning Activity 6.2

#### How is memory commonly defined in psychology?

Memory is defined as the active information processing system in which information accquired from learning is encoded, stored and retrieved.

---

#### Describe the processes of encoding, storage and retrieval

Encoding is the process of converting information into a form which can be used in the brain so that it can be stored.

Storage is the retention of information over time within the brain.

Retrieval is the process of accessing information from memory so we are consciously aware of it.

#### Explain the interrelationship between these processes with reference to an example

Information from the outside world or internal thoughts is first converted into a storable form via *encoding*. Then the representation of that information in put into *storage*. Finally, when the information is wanted, the brain accesses the relevent representation via *retrieval*.

If any one of these processes fails, memory fails.

#### Explain whether memory is possible without any one of these processes

Without encoding, there is no way for a memory trace to be properly created. Without storage there is no way to retain information over time. Without retrieval the information is inaccessible. Therefore, memory relies on the cooperation of all three of these processes and is impossible without proper functioning.

---

#### Explain why comparing human memory to information-processing by a computer may misrepresent or oversimplify human memory

Computers store memory in a very rigourous manner that is highly redundant whereas human memories tend to be much more malleable and may change as they are *representations of information* as opposed to the information itself.

Humans store different types of memory.

# Learning Activity 6.3

#### Explain the meaning of the term model of memory

A theory used to represent and describe the flow of memory through different functional components and processes.

#### Briefly describe the Atkinson-Shriffrin multi-store model of memory

The Atkinson-Shiffrin multi-store model of memory proposes that memory is composed of three different memory systems. The sensory memory system contains information that enters the body through the senses, the long-term memory system (LTM) which contains the bulk of retained memories, and the short-term memory system (STM) which interacts with sensory memory and LTM and acts as the area where information is integrated.

---

#### Distinguish between structual features and control processes in memory, with reference to examples

Structual features: the permanent, built-in fixed features of memory that do no vary from one situation to another, e.g. the three different stores and their function, storage capacity and storage duration of each component.

Control processes: a memory process that is under the consciou 'control' of the individual (i.e. not a built-in fixed feature) and is selected and used by the individual depending on the situation/what the individual is doing or needs to do, e.g. attention, rehearsal and retrieval.

#### Explain whether each of the following is a structual feature of control process:

| Deciding whether retrieved information is correct | Control process |
| A neural representation of a memory | Structual feature |
| Encoding | Control process and a structual feature |

# Learning Activity 6.4

#### Construct a research hypothesis that could have been tested by the procedures used in the experiment.

It was hypothesised that participants who use a partial report system where high, medium and low tones are associated with reporting the top, middle and bottom row of letters respectively will recall more letters from a briefly presented 3-by-4 visual array than participants who simply report as many letters as they can see after the arry is removed without a tone used to cue response.

#### State the operationalised IV(s) and DV(s).

IV: Whether a tone was used to cue recall
DV: The number of words reacalled

#### Name the experimental design.

Repeated measures.

#### Briefly state the results obtained.

Participants reported seeing more of the projected letters although failed to name them all. When a sound was used to indicate which row to recall, participants were able to recall the relevant row perfectly and about 75% of the total words.

---

#### If the results were shown to be statistically significant with p ≤ 0.05, what would this mean?

The probability that the difference in accuracy of recall between the groups was due to random chance alone was less than 5 in 100. If the significance level is p ≤ 0.05 then the result is statistically significant and support the hypothesis.

#### Would the results be more meaningful with p ≤ 0.01? Explain your answer.

The probability that the difference in accuracy of recall between the groups was due to random chance alone would be less than 1 in 100 as opposed to 5 in 100 for p ≤ 0.05. If the significance level is p ≤ 0.05 then both of the results are statistically significant and support the hypothesis.

---

#### Briefly state a conclusion based on the results obtained.

It can be concluded that for a split-second, participants had a virtually unlimited capacity of memory.

#### Comment on the extent to which the results can be generalised.

An experiment that showed statistically signifcant results was completed. Assuming a sample representative of the general population was used, the results may be generalised.

# Learning Activity 6.5

#### What is sensory memory?

Sensory memory is the entry point of memory where new incoming sensory information is stored in a raw (sensory) form for a very brief period.

#### Distinguish between the terms sensory memory and sensory register

The term sensory register refers to the memory storage for a particular sense whereas sensory memory refers to the collective memory encompassing all sensory registers. Each sensory register differs from one another as they have different capacities and durations.

#### Why can sensory memory be described as a memory system or sub-system rather than a perceptual system?

Sensory memory only deals with the storage and retention of sensory information whereas a perceptual system receives, processes and interprets the raw information in a meaningful way.

---

#### Define iconic memory and echoic memory with reference to examples that help clarify the definitions.

Iconic memory refers to visual memory which stores images in their original sensory form for 0.2-0.4 seconds such as what you see in your field of view.

Echoic memory is auditory memory which stores sounds in their original sensory form for 3-4 seconds such as sounds you can hear around you.

#### Describe the main distinguishing characteristics of iconic and echoic memory. Refer to the type of sensory information and the storage duration.

Iconic memory stores visual information whereas echoic memory stores auditory information. Iconic memory typically is retained for 0.3 seconds whereas echoic memory is typically retained for 4 seconds.

| Sensory register | Type of sensory information | Duration of storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Iconic memory | visual | 0.2-0.4 seconds |
| Echoic memory | auditory | 3-4 seconds |

---

#### In what way might sensory memory have an adaptive function and assist us in adjusting to ongoing environmental change?

Sensory memory filters out meaningless sounds and visual information around us, leaving the brain to focus its cognition on content that is more crucial for survival. Processing all sensory information would be overwhelming and leave us vulunerable.

#### Is information in sensory memory subject to an encoding process? Explain your answer.

While in sensory memory information is believed to be stored in a raw sensory form. However when paid attention it must be converted to a transmissable form and thus subjected to encoding before reaching STM.

---

#### What is required for information to transfer from sensory memory to STM?

For information in sensory memory to transfer into STM the information needs to be paid attention.

#### What happens to information that is not transferred to STM?

Information in sensory memory not paid attention to is filtered out of consciousness typically within a few seconds.

# Learning Activity 6.6

#### Define short-term memory (STM)

Short-term memory (STM) is a memory system with limited storage capcity in which information is stored for a relatively short time, unless renewed in some way.

---

#### What is the storage capacity of STM?

7 ± 2 items

#### Give an example of experimental research that could be conducted to test the capcity of STM

A researcher could ask a participant to listen to a list of words which are read aloud, and then ask them to recall as many as they can. The number of words recalled by a participant is typically 7 ± 2.

---

#### What is the storage duration of STM?

12 - 30 seconds, typically 20 seconds (assuming the information is not rehearsed in some way).

#### Give an example of experimental research that could be conducted to test the storage duration of STM

A researcher could ask a participant to listen to a list of words, and then ask them to recall as many as they can after progressively longer delays.

---

#### In what ways is STM like sensory memory and unlike sensory memory?

Both STM and sensory memory have very limited storage durations (both in the seconds) however sensory memory has an unlimited capacity compared to the 7 ± 2 items that storable within STM. Information in both memory stores is lost if not attended to. There is only encoding within STM. You are consciously aware of information in STM whereas you are not consciously aware of information in sensory memory.

---

#### Distinguish between sensory memory and short-term memory with reference to conscious awareness.

Information in sensory memory is not consciously accessible until it is paid attention to and subsequently transferred into short-term memory where you are consciously aware of it.

#### Explain why STM can be described as the 'seat of consciousness' but neither sensory memory nor LTM can be described in this way.

Information stored in sensory memory and LTM is not accessible directly to be consciously thought about, this ability is limited to the STM. The STM holds all information we are consciously aware of at any point in time. It is where all reasoning, feeling and thinking occurs.

---

#### Explain why STM is described as working memory.

STM is where all cognition and conscious processing of information occurs, in other words the 'working' desk for the brain.

#### In your opinion, is 'short-term memory' or 'working memory' the more appropriate term to describe the memory system that receives information from both sensory memory and LTM? Explain your answer.

Working memory is a more appropriate term as it indicates the important role the particular memory system plays in processing and cognition.

---

#### Describe two ways in which information is frequently lost from STM

Information is most often lost from STM as a result of decay or displacement. Decay occurs over time as information is not rehersed, typically after 20 seconds. Displacement occurs when information is 'pushed out' of STM by new information.

---

You walk from one room to another to pick something up, and when you arrive you have forgotten why you went to the room. You realise that you were thinking about something else and this made you forget the reason for being in the room.

#### Explain why this forgetting occurred in terms of the STM capcity and duration

Given that STM has a duration of approximately 20 seconds, by the time you would have walked from one room to another, 20 seconds may have passed and decay may have resulted in the memory of the purpose for you going to the room being filtered out of consciousness. Additionally, given that STM has a limited capacity of 7 ± 2 items, while walking to the room you may have passed other stimuli that might have entered short-term memory, displacing the purpose for your walk to the room.

# Learning Activity 6.8

#### Describe two key roles of the rehersal in memory

Maintaining information in short-term memory, transferring information from short-term memory to long-term memory and to aid LTM storage and retrieval.

---

#### Define the terms maintenance rehersal and elaborative rehersal

Maintenance rehearsal refers to continual repetition of information (vocally or sub-vocally) in order to retain it in short-term memory whereas elaborative rehersal refers to linking new information to other information already stored in memory to aid in its storage and retrieval from LTM.

#### Identify two important characteristics that distinguish these two forms of rehersal

Elaborative is a more active and effortful method of rehearsal compared to maintenance rehearsal. Maintenance rehearsal does not focus on the meaning of the information while elaborative rehearsal does. Maintenance rehearsal does not assist in the encoding of information into LTM.

---

#### Explain why elaborative rehersal is more effective than maintenance rehersal in enhancing retention of information in LTM

Information transferred to long-term memory by elaborative rehersal is encoded with meaningful links to other information already stored in LTM which aids in retrieval from LTM. Maintenance rehearsal does not link new information with any other information and is less effective in encoding information to LTM.

#### Describe three different ways to elaborate on information

- Analyse a personally relevant example of the concept
- Understand how conceps relate to others and how they interact
- Create a metaphor of the information

#### Apply your understanding of maintenance and elaborative rehersal to respond to the following question a teacher was asked by a student: 'Is it best to read my notes over and over again, or is there something else I could do to study for the exam?' Give two reasons for your answer.

Students should attempt to interlink topics and concepts to make sure they understand the meaning of what they are studying. Relate the conceps to examples of them acting in day-to-day life.

# Learning Activity 6.10

#### Describe the serial position effect

The serial position refers to the finding that free recall is better for items at the start and end of a list than items in the middle.

#### What are the primacy and recency effects? Why do they occur?

The primacy effect refers to the superior recall of items at the beginning of a list. This occurs because more attention is paid to the first few items of the list, making them more likely to be retained in long-term memory.

#### Why are items in the middle of a serial list recalled least?

The recency effect refers to the superior recall of items at the end of a list. This occurs because the last few items are likely to still be in STM. As a result of this, the superior recall is not apparent when delayed recall occurs.

---

#### What implications does the serial position effect have for a prosecutor or barrister presenting their case to a jury?

The start and end of the presentation will have the greatest effect on the jury's judgement.

#### What implications does the serial position effect have for three politicians before an election, each delivering a brief policy speech one after the other on television?

It is likely that the second candidate is disadvantaged compared to the other two candidates as their speech is expected to be the least remembered.

#### What implications does the serial position effect have for a potential employee deciding on their interview time when allowed to choose from an interview schedule?

The employee should choose to be first or last to ensure they are remembered by the interview panel.

---

You have just begun casual work at the local supermarket. On your first day you are introduced to 15 other employees, one after the other.

#### According to the serial position effect, which names are you most likely to remember and why?

The employees you are first introduced to and the employees you are last introduced to as a result of the primacy and recency effects respectively.

# Learning Activity 6.12

#### What is chunking?

Chunking refers to the grouping of seperate pieces of information into one 'chunk', a single unit.

#### How does chunking increase the capacity of the STM?

Rather than memorising seperate elements, it is more efficient to remember chunks, which contain two or more pieces of information.

---

Suppose you must memorise the following long list of words: banana, rabbit, paper, mango, staple, apple, chicken, orange, pencil and elephant. You are allowed to recall the words in any order you wish.

#### How could you use chunking to better ensure storage and recall?

Pair the words up into semantic pairs (e.g [banana, apple], [mango, orange], [rabbit, elephant] etc.)

---

#### Suggest an example of how chunking can improve recall from LTM

?

# Learning Activity 6.14

#### Define working memory without reference to Baddeley and Hitch's model of working memory

Working memory is the memory system in which information is integrated and manipulated for cognition.

#### How does Baddeley and Hitch's model describe the structure and function of working memory? Include reference to the episodic buffer.

Baddeley and Hitch's model describes working memory as being composed of 4 components that interact to form working memory. The central executive controls what information is selected to be integrated, such information is accessed from long-term memory and placed into the episodic buffer where it is integrated with other information such as visual information from the visuo-spatial sketchpad and auditory information from the phonological loop.

#### Construct a table in which you summarise the key features of all four working memory components

| Component | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Central executive | Switching, inhibiting and updates information |
| Phonological loop | Stores and manipulates auditory information |
| Visuo-spatial sketchpad | Stores and manipulates visual & spatial information |
| Episodic buffer | Temporary workstation that allows for integration of information |

#### Explain the relationship between the four components with reference to an example

When in class watching a lecture, your phonological loop processes and manipulates the speech of your teacher, slides and diagrams drawn on the board are interpreted and manipulated by the visuo-spatial sketchpad. The episodic buffer acts as a workspace for the integration of information from different sources, while your central executive selects, inhibits and updates information in long-term memory.

#### Suggest a reason why the phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad and episodic buffer are often described as 'slave systems' to the central executive.

The central executive selects, inhibits and updates information from other memory systems and as a result controls the flow of information between systems. The phonological loop, visuo-spatial sketchpad and episodic buffer all rely on the central executive to access information from long-term memory as well as orient attention.

---

Which of the four components of the working memory model is likely to directly transfer or retrieve each of the following types of information to or from LTM?

#### words?

Phonological loop

#### images?

Visuo-spatial sketchpad

#### sounds?

Phonological loop

#### auditory information other than sounds?

?

# Learning Activity 6.16

#### According to Craik and Lockhart's levels of processing framework, what determines how well information is stored in LTM?

The likelihood of information being retained depends on the level or depth of it's encoding.

#### Explain the meaning of the levels of processing concept

Information that is superficial and relatively meaningless is less likely to be retained in the long-term by memory systems when compared to meaningful information.

#### What type of information is more likely to be processed at a shallow level?

Structual information such as colours, shapes and patterns that make up the physical appearance of objects.

#### What type of information is more likely to be processed at a deep level?

Semantic and meaningful characteristics of a concept such as connotations and history.

#### Is elaborative rehersal different from elaborative encoding? Explain your answer

Elaborative rehersal is a theorised operation under Aitkinson and Shiffrin's model of memory that transfers information from STM to LTM whereas elaborative encoding is a method of creating meaning between items in order to encode them at a deeper level.

#### In what way can Craik and Lochart's levels of processing framework provide support for memory as a multi-store rather than a unitary system?

The different 'levels' of encoding suggest different tiers of memories from those that are more stable to those that are dwindling.

#### What is a common criticism of Craik and Lockhart's levels of processing framework?

Since deeper levels of encoding result from more effort being made it is unclear whether the extra effort or the deeper level of encoding is responsible for the stability of the memory.

Craik and Lockhart's theory also fails to explain how deeper processing leads to better memories.

# Learning Activity 6.19

#### What is long-term memory (LTM)?

Long-term memory is the memory system that stores vast amounts of information for long periods of time, possibly permanently.

#### Outline the organisation of LTM.

The LTM comprises of two sub-systems called declarative (relating to explicit memories) and non-declarative memory (relating to implicit memories). Declarative memory also has two sub-systems of its own, namely semantic and episodic memory.

#### Why are procedural memories described as non-declarative memories?

It does not require conscious effort to complete the activities or procedures in procedural memory as they are *implicitly* recalled.

#### List three key differences between episodic memories and semantic memories.

- Semantic memories to do not relate to a specific time or place whereas episodic memories do relate to specific times and places.
- Episodic memories relate to memories that cover a personally experienced event whereas semantic memories relate more closely to individual facts.
- Different areas of the brain are activated when accessing semantic memories vs episodic memories.

#### Distinguish between the implicit and explicit memory processes with reference to an example

Implicit memories are recalled without any effort being made whereas explicit memories are only recalled with conscious, intentional effort being made.

---

#### Which LTM system and/or sub-system involves ...

#### implicit memory?

Procedural memory

#### explicit memory?

Declarative memory

#### declarative memory?

Semantic and episodic memory

#### non-declarative memory?

Procedural memory

---

#### Why is information in LTM often described as 'inactive' information?

You are not generally aware of information in long-term memory until it is accessed, as a result that information is 'inactive' and doesn't effect actions you take until it is brought into short-term memory.

#### Which other memory system could also be described as storing inactive information? Why?

Sensory memory could be thought of as inactive as you are not immediately aware of the information until accessing it.

---

| Long-term memory | Features | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Procedural (implicit memory) | Actions or skills that have been learnt | How to walk |
| Declarative (explicit memory) semantic | Facts and knowledge | Earth is a planet |
| Declarative (explicit memory) episodic | Personal experiences or events | My 18th birthday party |

# Learning Activity 6.22

#### Why is organisation necessary in LTM?

Organisation is required within LTM in order to ensure that all information remains accessible and isn't lost amongst the vast amounts of other information.

---

#### What are two key features of how information is organised and stored in LTM?

Information is organised into conceptual nodes that have meaningful links that form a hiearchical structure.

#### How does retrieval of information from LTM occur? Explain with reference to spreading activation.

After an initial cue is triggered in the area of information relevant to what is wanted to be retrieved, spreading activation occurs and as a result nearby or meaningfully relevant nodes are more likely to be activated. This activation spreads until the information required is activated and retrieved.

#### Is spreading activation possible in the STM (or working memory)? Explain your answer.

No, as the same structure is not apparent in STM.

---

#### Give a definition of semantic network theory.

Semantic network theory suggests that LTM is composed of conceptual nodes that are linked with other nodes in a network. Links are made via meaningful connections between concepts. These links and nodes form a hiearchical structure.

#### List three key differences between LTM and STM

- LTM is relatively unlimited in terms of storage whereas STM is limited to 7 ± 2 items.
- LTM is relatively permanent in terms of duration whereas STM is limited to ~20 seconds.
- Organisation within LTM is organised in a semantic network whereas in STM there is not well-defined organisation.
