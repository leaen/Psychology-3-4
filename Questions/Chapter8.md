# Learning Activity 8.1

#### How is forgetting defined in psychology?

Forgettting is the inability to access previously stored memories.

---

#### Explain the meaning of availability and accessibility of information in relation to memory and forgetting.

Availability refers to the presence of information in memory whereas accessibility refers to whether or not that information can be located and retrieved.

#### Create a definition of forgetting that refers to both availability (or available) and accessibility (or accessible).

Forgetting refers to the inaccessibility of available memories.

#### In what way(s) is forgetting from both STM (or working memory) and LTM adaptive?

Removing certain traumatic episodes from memory may help an individuals sanity.

#### What effect could a participant's past experience have on the results of an experiment on forgetting?

If any information has a meaningful link to something already known or experienced by the participant then the test may become confounded as that information would be more likely to be retained.

---

#### What is a forgetting curve?

A forgetting curve refers to a plot of the percentage of information retained in memory over time.

#### Describe the pattern of forgetting indicated by a typical forgetting curve, referring to the rate and amount of forgetting over time.

Within the first hour information is lost from memory at the greatest rate, dropping to approximately 60% of the information recalled at this point. This rate slows when reaching the 24 hour point, and the remaining 40% or thereabouts is nearly indefinitely retained.

---

#### What factors can affect the rate and amount of forgetting?

The type of information is being learned (how to fly a plane nonsense syllables), over what time period the information is learn (2 minutes, 12 weeks, 10 years), how well the original information was encoded.

Samir has booked in for his learner permit test in four weeks. He intends to spend every second night in the next four weeks learning the road rules.

#### What impact would you expect this approach to learning over an extended period will have on both the rate and amount of forgetting after the test?

As the material was learnt over a longer period of time, it would be expected that the rate of information lost from memory would be slower compared to what would normally be expected for information learnt over a shorter period of time.
