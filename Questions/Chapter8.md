#### How is forgetting defined in psychology?

Forgettting is the inability to access previously stored information.

---

#### Explain the meaning of availability and accessibility of information in relation to memory and forgetting.

Availability refers to the presence of information stored in memory whereas accessibility refers to whether or not that information can be located and retrieved and therefore brought into consciousness.

#### Create a definition of forgetting that refers to both availability (or available) and accessibility (or accessible).

Forgetting refers to the inaccessibility of available memories.

---

#### In what way(s) is forgetting from both STM (or working memory) and LTM adaptive?

Being able to recall every single event or fact that enters your mind would become overwhelming and prevent the brain from processing more important information such as threats to livelihood and other survival related roles.

#### What effect could a participant's past experience have on the results of an experiment on forgetting?

If any information has a meaningful link to something already known or experienced by the participant then the test may become confounded as that information would be more likely to be retained.

---

#### What is a forgetting curve?

A forgetting curve is a graph showing the pattern or rate and amount of forgetting that occurs over time.

#### Describe the pattern of forgetting indicated by a typical forgetting curve, referring to the rate and amount of forgetting over time.

Within the first hour information is lost from memory at the greatest rate, with more than half of the original content being lost. This rate slows when reaching the 8 hour point, and the remaining 35% or thereabouts is stable.

---

#### What factors can affect the rate and amount of forgetting?

The type of information is being learned (how to fly a plane nonsense syllables), over what time period the information is learn (2 minutes, 12 weeks, 10 years), how well the original information was encoded.

---

Samir has booked in for his learner permit test in four weeks. He intends to spend every second night in the next four weeks learning the road rules.

#### What impact would you expect this approach to learning over an extended period will have on both the rate and amount of forgetting after the test?

As the material was learnt over a longer period of time, it would be expected that the rate of information lost from memory would be slower compared to what would normally be expected for information learnt over a shorter period of time.

# Learning Activity 8.5

#### Define the term retrieval cue with reference to examples of different types of retrieval cues

A retrieval cue is any stimulus that assists in the process of locating and retrieving information stored in memory. A retrieval cue may be semantic, phonological, phonetic or concerning physical appearance. Retrieval cues may also relate to the physical surroundings (context-dependent) or to a particular emotional state (state-dependent).

---

#### What is retrieval failure theory?

Retrieval failure theory suggests that information stored in memory becomes inaccessible due to a lack or failure to use appropriate cues to locate the information in LTM.

#### Why is retrieval failure theory sometimes called cue-dependent forgetting?

Retrieval failure theory is sometimes called cue-dependent forgetting as it refers to information becoming inacessible due to a failure to use the correct cues.

---

#### Give an example of retrieval failure not referred to in the text

Not being able to remember someones name a week after meeting them at a party.

#### Outline the strengths and limitations of retrieval failure theory

| Strengths | Limitations |
| --- | --- |
| Useful explanation for why when we sometimes know that we know information but it cannot be immediately retrieved (TOT) | Not able to account for the inaccessibility of anxiety-laden memories |
| Supported somewhat by the semantic network theory | Not able to account for the inaccessibility of memory caused by brain trauma or a neurodegenerative disease |
| --- | Unable to explain interference between memories |

---

#### What is the tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) phenomenon?

TOT is the feeling of being confident that you are able to remember a piece of information however you are unable to remember the information at that point in time. When the information is recalled, it tends to occur suddenly as if it was 'popping' into consciousness, often when the individual is not consciously thinking about it.

#### Give a psychological and physiological explanation of why TOT occurs

During TOT, generally some of the details of the information can be retrieved (e.g the first letter of a name) and these details cue the retrieval of other parts of the information until all of the information becomes accessible. The process suggests that information is stored in LTM in an organised way in a variety of forms.

Since memory recall involves a number of areas in the brain, if complete recall does not occur then it demonstrates a failure to access one or more of these areas.

#### What does TOT suggest about LTM storage?

Since TOT only effects specific types of information, it suggests that memories are stored in a variety of forms and in an oraganised way. TOT also suggests that retrieval is not an all-or-nothing process and that pieces of information can be retrieved. TOT also suggests that information already recalled (such as the first letter of someones name) can act as a retrieval cue to locate the rest of the information. TOT also suggests that information stored in LTM is inaccessible without the correct cues.

---

#### Explain whether TOT provides evidence for the semantic network theory

TOT suggests that information in memory is stored in a way that is connected in a relatively logical manner. This supports the proposals made by the semantic network theory that information is stored in a web of information stitched together by meaningful links.

# Learning Activity 8.6

#### Briefly describe the interference theory of forgetting

The interference theory of forgetting suggests that a failure to retrieve information from LTM is due to the interference by other memories, especially those which are similar.

#### Define retroactive interference and proactive interference

Retroactive interference refers to new information interfering with old information whereas proactive interference refers to old information interfering with new information.

#### Explain the key feature that distinguishes retroactive interferences from proactive interference

The order in which the information is learnt and whether the earlier or newer information is being recalled.

#### What two suggestions could be given to a VCE student studying for exams to help them minimise forgetting that may result from interference?

Seperate the types of information that are being learnt for each subject. The more different the information being learnt is, the less likely it is to be effected by interference. If this cannot be achieved for subjects that are inherently similar, subjects that have the potential to interfere with each other should be studied as far apart as possible to ensure there is as much time between learning as possible.

---

A friend of yours who is studying VCE French and Italian comments: 'Sometimes I find that studying for Italian actually makes it harder to remember the material I previously studied for French. Am I just imaginging this or could this really happen?'

#### Describe a response you could give with reference to one or more theories of forgetting.

It's likely that the information being learnt in each subject is interfering with the information learnt in the other subject as the content and syntax of both languages are similar.

---

Suppose you meet Harry and Emma on your first day of a vacation at a Gold Coast resort. First Harry tells you his room number. You listen carefully and commit it to memory. Later, Emma tells you her room number and you memorise it. That evening you try to go to Emma's room but discover that you can't remember which of the two numbers it is. You then try to recall Harry's number and realise you are also unsure about this.

#### Which type of interference would cause you to forget Emma's room number? What information caused the interference?

Retroactive interference caused by Emma's room number.

#### Which type of interference would cause you to forget Harry's room number? What information caused the interference?

Proactive interference caused by Harry's room number.

---

#### Can forgetting caused by interference be explained in terms of retrieval failure? If so, how? If not, why not?

Yes, as the retrieval cues leading to pieces of information may be changed during the learning of other information or be unable to change in the case of proactive interference.

#### Can forgetting caused by retrieval failure be explained in terms of interference? If so, how? If not, why not?

No?

---

#### Outline the strengths and limitations of interference theory

Limitation -> most experiments to study interference theory have used recall which is an especially vulunerable measure of retention to interference

# Learning Activity 8.7

#### Which data in the graph shows the results for group B? Explain your answer.

The green line as it is labelled for the normal waking activities.

#### Suggest an explanation of the results in terms of interference.

Group A who went to sleep immediately after the learning of the nonsense syllables limited the degree to which new information learnt during normal waking activity interfers with the sbility to retrieve the syllables. However, Group B did not undergo such prevention and were consequently more effected more interference with other information and performed worse on recall as a result.

#### Construct a research hypothesis for the experiment.

It was hypothesised that first-year university students who slept immediately after learning a list of nonsense syllables would be able to recall more from the list than those who slept after 30 minutes of normal waking activities.

#### Identify the operationalised variables.

Whether the participant's sleep was delayed or not.

#### Suggest two extraneous or confounding variables that may not have been adequately controlled and explain your choice of each variable.

- Natural memory ability or tendency to fall asleep (individual participant differences)
- Participants in Group B were tested 30 minutes longer from the learning section of the experiment than those in Group A

#### Write a possible conclusion for the experiment, ensuring that you refer to your answers above.

The hypothesis that first-year university students who slept immediately after learning a list of nonsense syllables would be able to recall more from the list than those who slept after 30 minutes of normal waking activities was supported by the results of the experiment.

On average 8 hours after learning, Group A who slept immediately after learning could recall on average 60% of the syllables compared to just 10% in Group B.

The DV may have been confounded by the differences in timing for each group. During the first assessment of retention at the 1 hour mark, Group A would have had 1 hour of sleep whereas Group B will have had just 1/2 hour of sleep. Differences in the position of the sleep cycle may effect cognition and therefore may confound the results of the experiment.

Convenience sampling from the psychology cohort at the university was used to select a sample for the experiment. There were no actions taken to control for individual participant differences such as memeory ability or tendency to fall asleep which may have effected the measurement of the DV by having a naturally innate memory or higher quality of sleep. In future studies, random stratified sampling should be used where possible.

#### Explain whether or not the results of the experiment can be generalised.

While the results of the experiment support the hypothesis, confounding and extraneous variables were not adequately controlled for the findings to be generalised to the population.

# Learning Activity 8.9

#### According to motivated forgetting theory, why are we sometimes motivated to forget? Explain with reference to an example not used in the text.

In order to protect mental stability and prevent emotions from taking over, the body may either consciously or unconsciously make certain memories inacessible to the conscious mind. An example might be not being able to remember traumatic childhood memories of abuse.

#### Explain the suggested roles of repression and suppression in forgetting.

Repression and suppression are proposed to be the mechanisms by which information is held from conscious retrieval in the motivated forgetting theory.

#### What is the key difference between repression and suppression?

Suppresion is primarly a conscious action whereas repression occurs unconsciously.

---

#### Outline the strengths and limitations of motivated forgetting theory.

- Difficult to study, as there is often no way to corroborate repressed memories.
- There is a general lack of experimental research to challenge or support Freud's theory due to ethical issues in the creation of repressed memories>

---

#### Briefly describe the decay theory of forgetting.

The decay theory of forgetting suggests that forgetting occurs from a period of time throughout which the neurological representation of memories (called a memory trace) are not accessed and as a result weaken.

#### What evidence or experiences suggests that 'information' in LTM may decay through disuse?

- (Wittlinger, 1975) showed that participants were able to recognise names and faces of people from their childhoood at a comparable level 50 years between tests

#### What evidence or experiences suggests that 'information' in LTM does not necessarily fade through disuse?

- Decay theory is unable to explain the resilience of procedural memory
- Decay theory has been unable to account for the sudden recollection of cues that sometimes occurs in the elderly.

#### To which other memory system(s) is decay theory more relevant?

Short-term memory and sensory memory where information in either system is filtered out of consciousness without renewal.

---

Suppose you were designing an experiment to test decay theory. The conditions for one of your experimental groups would have to be such that nothing affected the memory trace except the passage of time.

#### Is it possible to set up the conditions for this group to control the influence of extraneous variables that could affect the results such as retrieval failure, interference and motivated forgetting? Explain your answer.

Information can be constructed in a randomised way such that no interference can occur with existing information in LTM and information that is to be learnt between the start and end of the experiment. Usage of nonsense syllables would be unlikely to prompt motivated forgetting either consciously unsconiously. However retrieval failure would be difficult to account for as it would be impossible to determine whether a participant cannot recall a piece of information due to an inability to locate a retrieval due or degradation of the memory trace itself.

---

#### Outline the strengths and limitations of decay theory.

- Decay theory is unable to explain recollection of memories that were apparently 'lost'. For example, when seeing a friend who you have not seen in many years, you may be prompted to remember events or parties experienced with them that were otherwise inaccessible.

#### Read box 8.6 on comparing theories of forgetting and suggest a relevant example for retrieval failure theory.

Previous administrative officers carelessness have led to mislabelling of many entries, rendering certain information inacessible.

#### Construct a table that summaries theories of forgetting.

| Theory of forgetting | Strengths | Limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Motivated forgetting theory | --- | Difficult to study in an ethical manner as the creation of repressed memories is considered harming to the participant |
| Decay theory | --- | Doesn't explain the sudden flood of memories that may occur when meeting an old friend or the resilience of procedural memories  |
| Interference theory | Can be modelled by semantic network theory | Majority of research relies on recall which is a measure of retention that is very sensitive to interference |
| Retrieval failure theory | Corroborated by TOT phenomenon | Doesn't explain the failure to access memories lost as a result of head trauma or which are particularly anxiety-laden |
