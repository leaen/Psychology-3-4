# Learning Activity 8.1

#### How is forgetting defined in psychology?

Forgettting is the inability to access previously stored memories.

---

#### Explain the meaning of availability and accessibility of information in relation to memory and forgetting.

Availability refers to the presence of information in memory whereas accessibility refers to whether or not that information can be located and retrieved.

#### Create a definition of forgetting that refers to both availability (or available) and accessibility (or accessible).

Forgetting refers to the inaccessibility of available memories.

---

#### In what way(s) is forgetting from both STM (or working memory) and LTM adaptive?

Removing certain traumatic episodes from memory may help an individuals sanity.

#### What effect could a participant's past experience have on the results of an experiment on forgetting?

If any information has a meaningful link to something already known or experienced by the participant then the test may become confounded as that information would be more likely to be retained.

---

#### What is a forgetting curve?

A forgetting curve refers to a plot of the percentage of information retained in memory over time.

#### Describe the pattern of forgetting indicated by a typical forgetting curve, referring to the rate and amount of forgetting over time.

Within the first hour information is lost from memory at the greatest rate, dropping to approximately 60% of the information recalled at this point. This rate slows when reaching the 24 hour point, and the remaining 40% or thereabouts is nearly indefinitely retained.

---

#### What factors can affect the rate and amount of forgetting?

The type of information is being learned (how to fly a plane nonsense syllables), over what time period the information is learn (2 minutes, 12 weeks, 10 years), how well the original information was encoded.

Samir has booked in for his learner permit test in four weeks. He intends to spend every second night in the next four weeks learning the road rules.

#### What impact would you expect this approach to learning over an extended period will have on both the rate and amount of forgetting after the test?

As the material was learnt over a longer period of time, it would be expected that the rate of information lost from memory would be slower compared to what would normally be expected for information learnt over a shorter period of time.

# Learning Activity 8.5

#### Define the term retrieval cue with reference to examples of different types of retrieval cues

A retrieval cue is any stimulus that assists in the process of accesssing information stored in memory. An example of a retrieval cue may be a word that reminds of certain information like someones name. Another example of a retrieval cue is a picture of a family member.

---

#### What is retrieval failure theory?

Retrieval failure theory suggests that information stored in memory becomes inaccessible due to a lack of appropriate cues to lead to the location of the information.

#### Why is retrieval failure theory sometimes called cue-dependent forgetting?

Retrieval failure theory is sometimes called cue-dependent forgetting as it refers to information becoming inacessible due to the 'forgetting' of cues.

---

#### Give an example of retrieval failure not reffered to in the text

Not being able to remember someones name a week after meeting them at a party.

#### Outline the strengths and limitations of retrieval failure theory

Retrieval failure theory does explain the loss of memory that results from head trauma or the inability to access anxiety-laden memories however it is supported by semantic network theory and the TOT phenomenon.

---

#### What is the tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) phenomenon?

TOT is the feeling of being confident that you are able to remember a piece of information however at the present time you are unable to remember the information.

#### Give a psychological and physiological explanation of why TOT occurs

TOT occurs when only some of appropriate retrieval cues are located, leading to partial retrieval of the information.

#### What does TOT suggest about LTM storage?

Since TOT only effects specific types of information, it suggests that memories are stored in a variety of forms and in an oraganised way. TOT also suggests that retrieval is not an all-or-nothing process and that pieces of information can be retrieved.

---

#### Explain whether TOT provides evidence for the semantic network theory

TOT suggests that information in memory is stored in a way that is connected in a relatively logical manner. This supports the proposals made by the semantic network theory that information is stored in a web of information stitched together by meaningful links.

# Learning Activity 8.6

#### Briefly describe the interference theory of forgetting

The interference theory of forgetting suggests that a failure to retrieve information from LTM is due to the interference by other memories, especially those which are similar.

#### Define retroactive interference and proactive interference

Retroactive interference refers to new information interfering with old information whereas proactive interference refers to old information interfering with new information.

#### Explain the key feature that distinguishes retroactive interferences from proactive interference

The order in which the information is learnt and whether the earlier or newer information is being recalled.

#### What two suggestions could be given to a VCE student studying for exams to help them minimise forgetting that may result from interference?

Seperate the types of information that are being learnt for each subject. The more different the information being learnt is, the less likely it is to be effected by interference. If this cannot be achieved for subjects that are inherently similar, subjects that have the potential to interfere with each other should be studied as far apart as possible to ensure there is as much time between learning as possible.

---

A friend of yours who is studying VCE French and Italian comments: 'Sometimes I find that studying for Italian actually makes it harder to remember the material I previously studied for French. Am I just imaginging this or could this really happen?'

#### Describe a response you could give with reference to one or more theories of forgetting.

It's likely that the information being learnt in each subject is interfering with the information learnt in the other subject as the content and syntax of both languages are similar.

---

Suppose you meet Harry and Emma on your first day of a vacation at a Gold Coast resort. First Harry tells you his room number. You listen carefully and commit it to memory. Later, Emma tells you her room number and you memorise it. That evening you try to go to Emma's room but discover that you can't remember which of the two numbers it is. You then try to recall Harry's number and realise you are also unsure about this.

#### Which type of interference would cause you to forget Emma's room number? What information caused the interference?

Retroactive interference caused by Emma's room number.

#### Which type of interference would cause you to forget Harry's room number? What information caused the interference?

Proactive interference caused by Harry's room number.

---

#### Can forgetting caused by interference be explained in terms of retrieval failure? If so, how? If not, why not?

Yes, as the retrieval cues leading to pieces of information may be changed during the learning of other information or be unable to change in the case of proactive interference.

#### Can forgetting caused by retrieval failure be explained in terms of interference? If so, how? If not, why not?

No?

---

#### Outline the strengths and limitations of interference theory

Limitation -> most experiments to study interference theory have used recall which is an especially vulunerable measure of retention to interference
