# Learning Activity 2.3

### Define consciousness, with refernce to internal and external factors.
Conciousness refers to the awareness of your internal state and external surroundings.

### In what ways is consciousness personal, subjective, continuous and changing?
Your experience of consciousness is personal as it is unique to your memories and interpretation of surroundings. It is subjective as no one else has the same perspective as you. Continuous as there is no moment where your consciousness becomes empty. Changing as your consciousness is constnatly shifting in thoughts and ideas.

### Explain the term state of consciousness.
A state of consciousness refers to a current level of consciousness. This is often described by a list of qualities including level of awareness, self control, perceptual abilities, feelings and experience of time among others.

### What changes typically occur as a result of a change in a person's state of consciousness?
In a physiological sense, you may see changes in brain wave patterns, heart rate, electrical skin conductivity and eye movements.

In a psychological sense, you may see changes in judgement, cognitive abilities.

### Could we experience two different states of consciousness simultaneously?
No?

# Learning activity 2.5

### Define the meaning of normal waking consciousness.

Normal waking consciousness is when you are alert and aware of your feelings, thoughts and perceptions

### In what ways is the content of consciousness more limited in normal waking consciousness than in an alterted state of consciousness?

Often in an alterted state of consciousness your attention will be divided among multiple stimuli and you will be unable to concerntrate or complete tasks that require a large amount of cognitive effort.

### Distinguish between selective and divided attention with reference to an example not used in the text.

An example of selective attention (where you are only attentive to one stimuli) could be a watch-maker carefully laying down a minute hand into the watch casing, whereas divided attention (attention given to multiple stimuli) could be singing while you clean your room.

---

#### Explain the meaning of controlled and automatic processes in realtion to consciousness, with reference to to examples not used in the text.

Controlled processes are those in which selective attention and a large amount of cognitive effort is required such as balancing on a tightrope. Automatic processes require little cognitive effort and are often completed with divided attention such as talking.

#### Describe two differences between controlled and automatic processes in normal waking consciousness

In controlled processes, your attention will be solely focussed on one stimuli whereas with automatic processes your attention may be split up to more stimuli.

#### According to controlled and automatic processing theory, what level of attention and what type of awareness are required to learn a new task?

Selection attention with normal waking consciousness

---

### When the Stroop task is given to young children who have master their colours, but have not mastered their reading, the Stroop effect is not observed. Exaplin why this occurs with reference to controlled and automatic processing.

Since the children have no semantic meaning for the words, their brains to not require any extra time to process the colour, i.e their attention is selective and not divided.

# Learning Activity 2.6

#### Describe a task you have learned that initially involved controlled processing but that you can now perform using automatic processing.
Typing on a keyboard.

#### What change in level of attention was required to perform the task during learning comapred with after the learning?
Previously when learning, selective attention was used. After learning both selective and divded attention can be used with typing.

#### How do you know this task now involves automatic processing rather than controlled processing?
It is easy for me to type and speak or hold a conversation, without losing any accuracy

---

#### Describe a task that you are currently learning that involves controlled processing
Completing sudoku

#### How will you know when your performance of this task involves automatic processing
It is unlikely completing a sudoku will become a task that's able to be completed with automatic processing

# Learning Activity 2.7

| Feature | Automatic process | Controlled process |
| ---| ---| --- |
| Level of conscious awareness required | Low | High |
| Level of attention required | Divided attention | Selective attention |
| Speed at which the processing is performed | Fast | Slow |
| Task complexity | Low | High |
| Ability to undertake other tasks simultaneously | Impaired | Retained |
| Example | Listening to a story | Walking |

# Learning Activity 2.11

#### Define the term altered state of consciousness (ASC)
An altered state of consciousness is any state of consciousness that is strictly different from normal waking consciousness

#### In what main ways is an ASC different from normal waking consciousness?
In an ASC content limitations, awareness, self-control and time orientation can all be different than they would be in NWC

#### Can an ASC be experienced during normal waking consciousness? Explain your answer with reference to an example.
It is possible to experience an ASC during NWC. For example when at school a student my slip into an ASC and begin to daydream.

#### State two naturally occuring ASCs and two purposefully induced ASCs
| Naturally occuring | Purposefully induced |
| --- | --- |
| Sleep | Alcohol-affected |
| Daydreaming | Anaesthesised |

---

An employer is concenered that one of her employees has been arriving at work in an altered state of consciousness and is not in a fit state to operate the machinery for which he is responseible. She is not sure what the characteristics of different ASCs are and wants to be more confident of her information before discussing the issue with him.

##### Briefly describe four characteristics of ASCs that may be helpful for the employer to know

| Self-control | The employee may have less self-control over themselves. This may include physical self-control (e.g stumbling or less coordination) or emotional self-control (e.g seemingly unexplicable bursts of crying, happiness or anger) |
| Time orientation | The employee may struggle at gauging the speed at which time passes, perceiving time to either move slower than it actually does or faster. |
| Distortions in perception and cognition | The employee may begin to hallucinate or perceive sensations to be more vivid. |
| Emotional awareness | The employee may have a hightened or flat emotional response to events |

# Learning Activity 2.12

#### Define daydreaming
Daydreaming is an ASC in which we shift away from external stimuli to instead focus on internal thoughts

#### What is a possible explanation for daydreaming occuring more often when alone or doing routine or boring activites?
It is an attempt by the brain to create a more stimulating mindset that is perhaps more entertaining than the external environment


#### List three possible functions or purposes of daydreaming
- Daydreaming may help approach problems from a different angle
- Removes distractions when trying to focus
- To imagine situations that may never occur

#### Explain the meaning of alcohol-induced state of consciousness
An alcohol-induced state is what occurs after consuming alcohol

#### What factors influence the experience of an alcohol state of consciousness
BAC, gender, weight, food already eaten, amount of alcohol drunk

#### Give three examples of changes in consciousness that may be associated with alcohol consumption
Impaired emotional awareness, slower reaction times, impaired memory

# Learning Activity 2.14

Different brain wave patterns are associated with different levels of alertness and states of consciousness. For each of the following activities, state which kind of brain wave pattern would probably be dominant - alpha, beta, theta or delta

##### Lying on the beach, having just fallen asleep
Theta waves

##### Playing a computer game
Beta waves

##### Alcohol-induced state with a BAC level of 0.01%
Alpha waves

##### Alcohol-induced state with a BAC level of 0.4%
Theta waves

##### Sleepwalking that occurs in the deepest stages of sleep
Delta waves

##### Learning how to use a mathematical formula for the first time
Beta waves

##### Watching a Disney 'family' movie
Alpha waves

##### Watching a suspenseful horror movie
Beta waves

# Learning activity 2.15

#### Why is consciousness (and any ASC) referred to as a psychological construct?
There is no way of directly measuring or observing consciousness, so we instead call it a psychological construct

---

##### What is the galvanic skin response (GSR)?
The galvanic skin response is a psychological response that changes the electrical resistance of the surface of skin

##### Describe the GSR that could be expected of someone in an alcohol-induced state of consciousness
Lower alertness so decreased GSR

Construct a table to summarise the frequency (slow or fast) and amplitude (large or small) of the four different kinds of brain wave patterns. In addition, state whether each brain wave pattern is associated with normal waking consciousness or an ASC

| Brain wave pattern | Frequency | Amplitude | State of consciousness |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Beta | Fast | Small | NWC (focused) |
| Alpha | Fast | Small (bigger than beta) | NWC (relaxed) |
| Theta | Medium | Mix of small and large | Early sleep |
| Delta | Low | High | Deep sleep |

Construct a table to summarise how heart rate, body temperature and GSR may differ in relation to level of alertness, normal waking consciousness and specific ASCs.

| State of consciousness | Heart rate | Body temperature | GSR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Normal waking consciousness | Normal | Normal | Normal |
| Daydreaming | Normal | Normal | Decreased conductivity |
| Alcohol-induced state | Lowered | Normal | Increased conductivity |
| Sleep | Lowered | Lowered | Decreased conductivity |
