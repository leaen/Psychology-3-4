# Learning Activity 1.1

### What are two features that best distinguish an experiment from other research methods?
Experiments involve the manipulation of two seperate variables and make the best attempt to isolate any other possiblities that might change a measured outcome.

### Write a definition of each of the following terms as they apply to an experiment:
- *variable*: Any factor that can change or vary in amount or type over time.
- *independent variable*: The variable that is systematically manipulated for the purposes of the experiment in order to gauge a change in the dependent variable.
- *dependent variable*: The variable that is measured and shows any effects of the independent variable.

### What do researchers expect to happen to DVs when they manipulate IVs?
Researchers expect a hypothesis or prediction to hold, i.e they expect some sort of change that they have predicted to occur

### Identify the IV and DV in each of the following:
A. Receiving a reward for studying will increase the amount of time students engage in studying.

- *IV*: Whether a reward is given to a student for studying
- *DV*: The amount of time a student studys for

B. People who are in love perceive each other more positively than other people perceive them.

- *IV*: Whether an individual is in in love
- *DV*: The way an individual perceives their partner

C. Recall of information presented early in a list is better than recall of information presented later in a list.

- *IV*: The location of information in a list
- *DV*: How well remembered that information is

D. People react quicker to sounds than to visual stimuli.

- *IV*: Whether a stimulus is given visually or aurally
- *DV*: The reaction time to a stimulus

E. Using adult language when talking to infants improves their vocabulary.

- *IV*: Whether an infant is talked to with adult language
- *DV*: The size of the infants vocabulary after a period of time

F. People change the pitch of their voice when lying

- *IV*: Whether someone is lying or not
- *DV*: The pitch of someones voice

G. People who suffer from depression recall more negative experiences than positive experiences.

- *IV*: Whether someone is depressed or not
- *DV*: The types of experiences someone tends to recall

H. Daydreaming occurs more frequently during simple tasks than during complex tasks.

- *IV*: The difficulty of a task
- *DV*: The frequency that daydreaming occurs

I. Workers on an assembly line are more productive when working alone than in a small group.

- *IV*: Whether workers work alone or in a small group
- *DV*: The productivity of those workers

# Learning Activity 1.2

A researcher noticed that some of her laboratory rats stood on their hind legs for a moment whenever their food was brought into the laboratory. She decided to test whether she could teach the rats to stand on their hind legs when she rang a bell.

First she measured the exact amount of time the rats spent standing when the food was brought in. Then she rang a bell just before each meal. The rats eventually started to stand on their hind legs when they heard the bell.

### What two IVs are being manipulated in the experiment?
Whether food was brought or not, and whether a bell was rung or not

### What is the DV in this experiment and how is it measured?
The dependent variable in this experiment is how long the rats stood on their hind legs

### Why did the researcher measure the rats' movements before introducing the ringing bell?
The researcher measured a baseline to be able to differentiate between any preexisting standing and allow her to check if the length of time they stood up for changed after introducing the bell

# Learning Activity 1.5

### Define the meaning of the terms extraneous variable and confounding variable.
- *extraneous variable*: Any varible outside the scope of the experiment that has an affect on the IV or the DV.
- *confounding variable*: Any variable other than the IV that _has_ an unwanted affect on the DV, making it impossible to determine which of the variables has produced the change in the DV.

### In what key way are extraneous and confounding variables similar and different?
Extraneous and confounding variables both variables outside the scope of the experiment that potentially affect either the IV or DV in an experiment. Confounding variables are extraneous variables that _have_ caused a change in the DV.

### Give two reasons to explain why it is essential to control extraneous and potentially confounding variables in research.
If these variables aren't controlled for they may render the experiment and its reseults invalid and therefore unusable. They also can lead to inaccurate conclusions in research.

A researcher is planning an experiment to investigate the rate of forgetting (how much time it takes) and amount of forgetting (how much information) that occurs when new information (e.g. a list of nonsense 'words' such as qab and jir) is learned.

#### Identify the IV(s) and DV(s)
- *IV*: Whether normal english words or made up words are used in the test
- *DV*: The time and amount of forgetting that occurs

#### Identify two extraneous or potential confounding variables that could affect the DV (in addition to the IV) and therefore need to be controlled
A possible confounding variable would be that some individuals have a better memory than others and would therefore be able to remember more words. A possible extraneous variable would be that the made up words sound or look similar to english words.

#### Suggest a way that each variable reffered to in part (b) could be controlled
Use a suitable sampling method to ensure both the control and experimental group are equally balanced in terms of baseline memory. Ensure that all the nonsense words given to the experimental group are the same.

An experiment was conducted to test whether people make fewer errors in detecting spelling errors in an interesting text than in a boring one. Two groups of randomly selected and allocated participants were used. Group 1 looked for errors in a physics text on string theory (a boring task) and Group 2 looked for errors in the script of a Twilight move (an interesting task). The results showed that Group 1 detected significantly fewer spelling errors than did Group 2.

#### Identity the IV, DV and a potential confounding variable in the experiment.
- *IV*: Whether the participant was given an interesting or boring text to check for spelling errors
- *DV*: The number of spelling errors found by the participant
- *Confounding variable*: What one person finds interesting another people may find boring. For example in this exact choice of books (string theory and Twilight), if a physics professor participated in the experiment, the choice of books would be inappropriate as the professor would find the string theory book interesting and the Twilight book boring.

# Learning Activity 1.7

#### What is a placebo in relation to experimental research?
A placebo is the the effect of a participant believing that something should happen

#### Define the term placebo effect with reference to an example not used in the text.
The placebo effect is the effect of someone believing that an event will occur, and therefore they will believe that it has occured

#### Explain why the placebo effect is a potential confounding variable.
In instances where the placebo effect has a noticeable and measureable effect on the DV, it may lessen the apparent effect of manipulating the IV. (i.e you are setting an inaccurate baseline)

---

#### Define the meaning of the term experimenter effect.
*Experimenter effect*: The experimenter effect refers to the possiblility of actions, biases or expectations made by an experimenter causing a change in a participants response. This is a potentially confounding variable if not controlled for.

---

#### What is experimenter expectancy
Experimenter expectancy is the bias made by an experimenter when conducting an experiment. It may involve misreading data or misintrepreting reactions/results so that their expectations remina true.

#### How can experimenter expectancy produce ...
##### a self-fulfilling prophecy?
An experimenter may hint a participant towards looking at something more closely or by giving them more attention over others. This may lead to them doing what the experimenter 'wanted' to see, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

##### experimenter bias?


#### Explain why experimenter effects are potential confounding variables.
If not properly controlled for by using a double-blind procedure, it is impossible to determine the degree to which the experimenter effects changed the DV. Therefore it is impossible to reliably measure any change that the IV has made on the DV.

---

#### Suggest a way of controlling or minising the influence of a placebo effect
Use a double-blind procedure

#### Suggest a way of controlling or minising the influence of an experimenter effect
Use a double-blind procedure


# Learning Activity 1.8

##### Explain the meaning of the order effect
The order effect is the influence that the sequence of trials can have when using a repeated measured experimental design.

##### Distinguish between practice effects and carry-over effects with refrences to how these order effects can lead to higher or lower scores on a measure of the DV
Practice effects refer to the participant getting better at completing a task by having completed it in a past trial, often leading to a better score.

Carry-over effects refer to the influence of previous trials or treatments on the current trial. For example if testing the effects of a new drug on focus when completing a crossword, it is important that the participants are given the drug after having completed a control.

##### Explain why order effects are potential confounding variables
Since order effects can influence a participants performance on the DV, it makes it harder for experimenters to determine the degree to which the IV changed the DV.

---

##### Explain the meaning of the term non-standardised in relation to research procedures
An experiment has non-standardised procedures when the procedures used for all participants is not uniform.

##### Give an example of an instruction to participants and one or more experimental procedures that would be considered to be non-standardised
During an experiment on the effects of ambient noise on reaction time, one participant is instructed to press a button when they hear a particular name. Another participant is instructed to press a button when they hear any name.

During an experiment it is important that participants all complete tasks under the same conditions. For example in an experiment measuring the effect of something on balance, it is best to have all participants complete their trial when it is not windy.

##### Explain why non-standardised instructions and procedures are potentially confounding variables

As non-standardised instructions and procedures can have a measureable influence on the DV, they become confounding variables if introduced into a study.

# Learning Activity 1.10 q1-5a

#### What are random sampling, stratified sampling and random-stratified sampling?
- *random sampling*: Random sampling is selecting a sample of a set size at random from a population without any consideration for the characteristics of the sample
- *stratified sampling*: Stratified sampling involves breaking down a population into groups sharing a particular characteristic called strata. Participants are then sampled from each of the strata.
- *random-stratified sampling*: Similar to stratified sampling, although the selection from each strata is random

#### In what way is a random sample and a stratified sample alike? In what way are they different?
A random sample and a stratified sample both contain the same sample size, however a stratified sample shares the same proportion of each strata as the total population.

Suppose that you are required to determine the sleep patterns (e.g. the amount of sleep of student at your school or college)

##### Briefly describe a convenience sampling, random sampling and random-stratified sampling procedure for selecting research participants.
- Convenience sampling - Put a poster up and accept participants who express interest
- Random sampling - Put a poster up and record participants who express interest for a particular period. After applications have closed, randomly select a number of participants.
- Stratified-random sampling - Put a poster up and record participants who express interest for a particular period. After applications have closed, group participants into strata (perhaps by age or year level) and then randomly select participants in the same proportions as the school or college.

##### Explain which of the three sampling procedures would result in the more representative sample
Stratified-random sampling is the most representative procedure to use as it constructs a sample in the same proportions as the testable population.

##### Are any of the three procedures unnecessary for this particular research? Briefly explain your answer.
The stratification of the population may not be needed for this research as there are no groups that require controlling for.

The rating of a TV show is determined by the size of the audience who watches it. The rating is based on data from an electronic recording device attached to a TV set in a viewer's home. The device automatically records which TV show is being watched and for how long. Viewers also indicate who in the household is watching. Suppose you are responsible for determing the TV ratings of the viewing audiene in Melbourne for a one-week period.

##### Briefly describe the sampling procedure you could use to select the participants who will receive a recording device
Break the testable population down into groups of strata, based on their age-group. Then, randomly select a sample from each strata in the same proportions as previous market research.

##### Explain how your procedure would ensure a representative sample of the viewing population
By making use of previous market research, the interest by age-group in the TV show is already known. This allows us to construct the most representative sample by choosing our sample for the research in the same proportions

#### Explain why each of the following research studies is likely to haev a sample bias:
##### A survey on binge-drinking behaviour in a popular teenager's magazine
Since the audience of a popular teenager's magazine aren't likely to be the same group that engage in binge-drinking, the result from the study will be an biased and underestimate the amount of individuals engaging in binge-drinking

##### A television or radio call-in survey
Those who call-in obviously show some interest in the topic and therefore my themselves be biased when compared to a population

##### A telephone survey at 6pm on weeknights using landlines to people's homes
This would underrepresent people who may not be home at 6pm on a weeknight and those who don't pick up or own a landline phone.

# Learning Activity 1.12

#### What is the main difference between participant selection and participant allocation?

Participant selection is the process of selecting a partcipant to be part of the study, while participant allocation decides the experimental group they will be in.

#### What is random allocation and why is it used in an experiment?

Random allocation is the process of randomly assigning participants in the sample to an experimental group. It is used to minimise bias from either group.

#### How are random allocation and random sampling different?

Random allocation is the process of randomly allocating participants in the sample to an experimental group. Random sampling is the process of randomly selecting participants from a population to be in the sample

#### What is an experimental group? A control group?
- *experimental group*: The experimental group is the group in which the IV is manipulated to test the hypothesis in the experiment
- *control group*: The control group is the group in which the IV is not changed and serves to give a baseline response which is needed in order to measure the change manipulating the IV makes

#### Consider the following fictitious examples of research studies and identify any ethical issues

###### A psychology lecturer at a university was studying techniques for reducing fear of spiders. He asked a research assistant to telephone students in the first-year psychology course he was teaching to determine their willingness to participate. The research was unaware that the asssistant told participants they had to participate.

Although it was not the intention of the lecturer, the ethical principle of voluntary participation was breached. The students were not given an option to not participate and were told they have to. It can be reasonably assumed that they would not be allowed to withdraw from the experiment either, this is another ethical violation.

---

###### A researcher was interested in factors influencing cheating. She gave participants an exam, then collected and photocopied their answers. The participants were not informated about the photocopying. The answers were returned unmarked and the participants were given the opportunity to cheat while marking their own papers. The answers were collected again and compared with the photocopies.

There is a reasonable use of deception in this experiment, as the knowledge that their papers would be photocopied before marking would influence the decisions of the participants. However the use of deception should be properly described when debriefing the participants following the experiment, the reasons for the use of deception should be described.

---

###### An experiment was conducted to assess driver reaction to a stressful situation. Each participant was asked to drive a car past a construction site. The researcher rigged a human-looking dummy in such a way that it would be propelled in front of the car, making it impossible for the participant to avoid hitting it. The participants reacted as expected. When they learned the situation was faked, they informed the researcher of their displeasure. Despite their complaints, the researcher continued testing further participants (adapted from Wood, 1981).

In this experiment participants are obviously affected by the thought of having a human propelled into their car and likely killed in the process. The researcher has a responsiblity to ensure that there is no permanent harm that arises to any participant from a result of taking part in the experiment. The researcher is therefore violating the no-harm principle, and continuing to run the experiment with more participants with the knowledge that it causes harm to them, is a violation of ethical guidelines. The researcher should additionally supply counselling services to those who have already been harmed in the experiment.

---

###### A VCE Psychology student was required to undertake a research investigation to satisfy the course requirements. The student researcher replicated an experiment on learning that involved classical conditioning of an eye-blink response using two preschool children and two adults as participants. The student researcher thought that the adult participants' knowledge of the conditioning procedure would affect the results in an unwanted way and decided not to seek their informed consent. The student researcher also based their decision on the belief that the condition procedure was physiologically and psychologically harmless. The student researcher did, however obtain informed written consent form both parents of each child.

If the student can be sure that no harm arises from the use of deception in the experiment and the adults are both properly debriefed on the reasons and details of the use of deception then no ethical guidelines were violated.
