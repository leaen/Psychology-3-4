# Learning Activity 1.1

### What are two features that best distinguish an experiment from other research methods?
Experiments involve the manipulation of two seperate variables and make the best attempt to isolate any other possiblities that might change a measured outcome.

### Write a definition of each of the following terms as they apply to an experiment:
- *variable*: Any factor that can change or vary in amount or type over time.
- *independent variable*: The variable that is systematically manipulated for the purposes of the experiment in order to gauge a change in the dependent variable.
- *dependent variable*: The variable that is measured and shows any effects of the independent variable.

### What do researchers expect to happen to DVs when they manipulate IVs?
Researchers expect a hypothesis or prediction to hold, i.e they expect some sort of change that they have predicted to occur

### Identify the IV and DV in each of the following:
A. Receiving a reward for studying will increase the amount of time students engage in studying.

- *IV*: Whether a reward is given to a student for studying
- *DV*: The amount of time a student studys for

B. People who are in love perceive each other more positively than other people perceive them.

- *IV*: Whether an individual is in in love
- *DV*: The way an individual perceives their partner

C. Recall of information presented early in a list is better than recall of information presented later in a list.

- *IV*: The location of information in a list
- *DV*: How well remembered that information is

D. People react quicker to sounds than to visual stimuli.

- *IV*: Whether a stimulus is given visually or aurally
- *DV*: The reaction time to a stimulus

E. Using adult language when talking to infants improves their vocabulary.

- *IV*: Whether an infant is talked to with adult language
- *DV*: The size of the infants vocabulary after a period of time

F. People change the pitch of their voice when lying

- *IV*: Whether someone is lying or not
- *DV*: The pitch of someones voice

G. People who suffer from depression recall more negative experiences than positive experiences.

- *IV*: Whether someone is depressed or not
- *DV*: The types of experiences someone tends to recall

H. Daydreaming occurs more frequently during simple tasks than during complex tasks.

- *IV*: The difficulty of a task
- *DV*: The frequency that daydreaming occurs

I. Workers on an assembly line are more productive when working alone than in a small group.

- *IV*: Whether workers work alone or in a small group
- *DV*: The productivity of those workers

# Learning Activity 1.2

A researcher noticed that some of her laboratory rats stood on their hind legs for a moment whenever their food was brought into the laboratory. She decided to test whether she could teach the rats to stand on their hind legs when she rang a bell.

First she measured the exact amount of time the rats spent standing when the food was brought in. Then she rang a bell just before each meal. The rats eventually started to stand on their hind legs when they heard the bell.

### What two IVs are being manipulated in the experiment?
Whether food was brought or not, and whether a bell was rung or not

### What is the DV in this experiment and how is it measured?
The dependent variable in this experiment is how long the rats stood on their hind legs

### Why did the researcher measure the rats' movements before introducing the ringing bell?
The researcher measured a baseline to be able to differentiate between any preexisting standing and allow her to check if the length of time they stood up for changed after introducing the bell

# Learning Activity 1.5

### Define the meaning of the terms extraneous variable and confounding variable.
- *extraneous variable*: Any varible other than the IV that _can_ cause a change in the DV.
- *confounding variable*: Any variable other than the IV that _has_ an unwanted affect on the DV, making it impossible to determine which of the variables has produced the change in the DV.

### In what key way are extraneous and confounding variables similar and different?
They both are unwanted in experiments, but only confounding variables affect the experiments results

### Give two reasons to explain why it is essential to control extraneous and potentially confounding variables in research.
If these variables aren't controlled for they may render the experiment and its reseults invalid and therefore unusable. They also can lead to inaccurate conclusions in research.

A researcher is planning an experiment to investigate the rate of forgetting (how much time it takes) and amount of forgetting (how much information) that occurs when new information (e.g. a list of nonsense 'words' such as qab and jir) is learned.
### Identify the IV(s) and DV(s)
- *IV*: Whether normal english words or made up words are used in the test
- *DV*: The time and amount of forgetting that occurs

### Identify two extraneous or potential confounding variables that could affect the DV (in addition to the IV) and therefore need to be controlled
A possible confounding variable would be that some individuals have a better memory than others and would therefore be able to remember more words. A possible extraneous variable would be that the made up words sound or look similar to english words.

### Suggest a way that each variable reffered to in part (b) could be controlled
Use a suitable sampling method to ensure both the control and experimental group are equally balanced in terms of baseline memory. Ensure that all the nonsense words given to the experimental group are the same.
