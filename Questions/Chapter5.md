#### Briefly describe the two main functions of the somatic nervous system

The somatic nervous system functions to recieve sensory input from the outside world and to send out information to muscles and organs in order to make them function.

#### Give an example of each of these functions, using examples not referred to in the text.

Sensory or afferent neurons would be used when completing an eyesight test, while motor or efferent neurons would be used when giving someone a hi-5.

#### Distinguish between the roles of sensory and motor neurons

Sensory neurons are responsible for to feeling and sensing and send information to the CNS, while motor neurons recieve information from the CNS and send information to muscles and organs.

#### What are interneurons and where are they found?

Interneurons and neurons that connect sensory neurons to motor neurons. They are found exclusively in the CNS and are most abundant in the brain.

#### Whenever you reach to pick up a glass of water on a table, both the sensory and motor functions of the somatic nevous system are involved. Explain both the sensory and motor roles of in grasping the glass.

The sensory neurons relay information about seeing the glass of water on the table to the brain, and aid in positioning your hand around the glass. Motor neurons are responsible for the movements made in your arm and hand muscles in order to tighten your grip on the glass to pick it up.

#### Explain why the autonomic nervous system is described as autonomous

Since the organs that autonomic system controls are largely controlled involuntarily, the system is labelled as being autonomous.

#### Is 'autonomous' an accurate term for describing this nervous system? Explain with reference to an example.

Some of the organs controlled by the autonomic nervous system can be regulated voluntarily for example blinking and breathing.

---

#### Explain the relationship of the autonomic nervous system to the central nervous system with reference to a physiological response.

When being spooked in a scary movie, the CNS may send messages to the PNS to speed up heartrate after a jump scare.

#### What is a key different between skeletal muscles and visceral muscles?

Visceral muscles are continuously regulated whereas skeletal muscles can remain relaxed or contracted.

#### Which is more important in maintaining our survival: the autonomic nervous system or the central nervous system? Explain with reference to an example.

The autonomic nervous system is more important as it aids in preparing the body to flee or flight prey. Heartrate and breathing speed up, preparing the body for physical activity and epinephrine is secreted from the adrenal glands. The central nervous system is unable to make similar changes to the bodys vital organs without communicating with the autonomic nervous system to do so.

#### In what main way do the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system differ?

The sympathetic nervous system responds to threats and dangerous situations whereas the parasympathetic nervous system regulates normal conditions.

---

#### What is the role of the sympathetic nervous system in enhancing survival?

The sympathetic system allows for heightened alterness and immediate responses to danger and threats that may occur. In a evolutionary perspective, if you are able to react quicker to attacks, you are more likely to survive prey.

#### Give three examples of bodily functions that increase their activity as a result of sympathetic nervous system activation.

- Heartrate
- Epinephrine secretion
- Breathing rate

#### Give three examples of bodily functions that decrease their activity as a result of sympathetic nervous system activation.

- Stomach digestion
- Salivation
- Liver sugar release

---

#### Describe the main roles of the parasympathetic nervous system.

To maintain normal functioning in the body.

#### Give three examples of bodily functions that are affected as a result of the parasympathetic nervous system. Briefly explain the purpose of these changes if resulting from parasympathetic nerous system activation.

- Bile production increases → allows you to digest more food
- Fat release decreases → prevents wasting energy
- Decreased sweating → prevents dehydration

---

#### Give two reasons to explain why it takes longer for the parasympathetic nervous system to 'slow down' bodily functions that it does for the sympathetic nervous system to 'speed up' bodily functions.

Hormones like epinephrine that are secreted after activation of the sympathetic nervous system do not disspate immediately and linger around the bloodstream. These hormones prevent the parasympathetic nervous system from taking control. It is often likely for the body to try and 'keep its guard up' and not activate the parasympathetic nervous system until danger has definitely passed.
