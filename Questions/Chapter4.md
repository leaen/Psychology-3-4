#### What is the central nervous system?

The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord.

#### What are its main roles in mental processes and behaviour?

The CNS is the chief officer of the body's functions. It constantly regulates heartrate, breathing, digestion but also is responsible for perceiving information from the sense (sent from the peripheral nervous system via the spinal cord) and responding to those inputs by sending back motor signals for muscles.

#### What are the main functions of the cerebral cortex?

The cerebral cortex provides most of the functionality for higher-order thinking and processing. This includes perception, language, learning, memory, thinking and problem-solving. It is also responsible for the planning and signalling of movements, such as writing and running.

#### Where is the cerebral cortex located?

The cerebral cortex is located in the 2-4mm thick convoluted and folding layer around the outside of the brain.

#### Of what does the cerebral cortex mainly consist?

Neurons

#### Name the three different categories of cortical areas and briefly describe the functions performed by each of these areas.

The motor cortex
The visual cortex
The auditory cortex

#### Describe the relationship between the size of the cerebral cortex and the mental capabilities of an organism.

Generally, there is a positive correlation between the size of the cerebral cortex in an organism and its abilities. That is to say a larger cerebral cortex in proportion to the rest of the organisms body, suggests greater intellgence.

#### What is a cerebral hemisphere?

The cerebral hemisphere are the two nearly identical halves of the brain, seperated by the longitudinal fissure.

#### Briefly describe three key characteristics that the cerebral hemispheres have in common.

Each of the hemispheres contains a motor, visual and auditory cortex. The locations of these corticies are also mirrored in the hemispheres. Both hemispheres also receive information from the opposing side of the body.

---

#### Name the deep groove that appears to seperate the hemispheres.

Longitudinal fissure.

---

#### What is the corpus callosum?

The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve tissue that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain.

#### Where is the corpus callosum located?

Along the longitudinal fissure below the frontal lobe. (?)

#### What key function is performed by the corpus callosum?

The corpus callosum is the major interconnect between the two cerebral hemispheres and relays information from one side of the brain to the other.

---

#### Suggest the possible impact on mental processes and behaviour if the corpus callosum were to be cut in tow and it was no longer an intact 'bridge'. Explain your answer.

Without the corpus callosum, the two cerebral hemispheres would be unable to properly communicate. As a result, functioning that requires information from both hemispheres would be unable to occur. This includes but is not limited to coordination in visual processing, some perceptions, and impaired motor control.

# Learning Activity 4.7

##### Construct a table that summarises the major functions of each lobe. Ensure that you name the main structures and areas, and include key functions of relevant sensory, motor, association and language areas.

##### Frontal lobe
- Primary mortex cortex
  * Responsible for the control of voluntary movements
  * Contralateral organisation (left hemisphere controls right side of body and vice versa)

- Broca's area
  * Responsible for the production of speech
  * Found in the left hemisphere for 95% of patients
  * Damage to this area leads to difficulty in forming grammarical structure (Broca's aphasia)
  * Comprehension and understanding of words remains unaffected when damaged

- Association areas
  * Prefrontal cortex
  * Receives and combines information from within the frontal lobe and other lobes to plan and execute more complex tasks
  * Control of emotion, expression of emotion

##### Parietal lobe
- Primary somatosensory cortex
  * Responsible for receiving somatosensory information from the peripheral nervous system via the spinal cord
  * Somatosensory information includes touch, temperature, pressure on the skin, position of muscles

- Association areas
  * Ability to sense our bodys position in space by combining information about the position of muscles and joints and information from the primary visual cortex

##### Temporal lobe
- Primary auditory cortex
  * Responsible for processing features of sound such as frequency and amplitute
  * Music is processed in different areas of the primary auditory cortex due to changes in frequency and amplitute

- Medial temporal lobe
  * Contains the hippocampus and amygdala
  * Crucial for long-term memory formation

- Wernicke's area
  * Located just above the primary auditory cortex usually in the left hemisphere
  * Required in order to process auditory cues of language (i.e speech)
  * Damage to this area leads to difficulty in forming coherency in speech, although words themselves are still clear (Wernicke's aphasia or fluent aphasia)
  * Pitch, tone and rate of speech still sound normal
  * Key content is left out and instead substituted with nonsense

- Association areas
  * Receiving, processing and storing memories of facts (semantic memories)
  * Personal experiences such as a party or birthday (episodic memories)
  * Visual perception, e.g identifying shapes and objects

##### Occipital lobe
- Primary visual cortex
  * Responsible for the processing of visual information sent from photoreceptors in the eyes
  * Located at the very back of the occipital lobe
  * The left visual field is processed in the right occipital lobe and vice versa

- Association areas
  * Communication with other areas to form visual memories, process writing
  * Essential for spacial reasoning

Following a head injury sustained in a car accident, Sofia is unable to feel any sensation of touch or temperature in an area on the left side of her face between her cheeks and her lower jaw. Fortunately Sofia did not damage her spine.

#### Which brain area is likely to be affected?

The somatosensory cortex is most likely to have been damaged as Sofia is having difficulty receives somatosensory information from her face such as the sensation of touch and temperature of her skin.

#### In which lobe is this area located?

The somatosensory cortex is located in the parietal lobe.

# Learning Activity 4.9

#### Explain the meaning of the term hemispheric specialisation (or laterialisation) in relation to the cerebral cortex

Each of the hemispheres of the cerebral cortex have a number of tasks that the majority of processing occurs within that hemisphere. These are called specialisations.

---

| --- | Left hemisphere | Right hemisphere |
| Cognitive functions | Processes sensory information from right side of the body | Processes sensory information from left side of the body |
| Behavioural functions | Controls right side of the body | Controls left side of the body |
| Non-verbal functions | --- | Specialisation in skills that do not require language, e.g spatial thinking, recognition of faces, appreciating music and art, creative thinking, daydreaming, processing facial expressions |
| Verbal functions | Broca's area, Wernicke's area | --- |
| Analytical functions | Specialisation in breaking tasks down into key parts, logical reasoning, maths, sequential tasks | --- |

---

#### Identify the hemisphere (left or right) that specialises in these cognitive and behavioural functions:

- Left hemisphere
  * Listening to someone speak
  * Applying logic in an argument
  * Working out if you have enough money for a holiday
  * Speaking on the telephone
  * Giving someone the correct change for their purchases
  * Working out when you have to get up in the morning to get to school on time
  * Raising your right hand to answer a question in class

- Right hemisphere
  * Appreciating the beauty of a forest
  * Kicking a football with the left foot
  * Daydreaming about being rich and famous
  * Judging whether a car will fit into a parking space
  * Finding your way around a maze
  * Working out the meaning of a grin on someone's face
  * Arranging a bouquet of flowers
  * Recognising classmates from an old class photo

- Not sure
  * Playing golf on a Wii
  * Playing scrabble on an iPad
  * Playing Angry Birds on a phone

#### A friend tells you about an internet test that determines hemispheric dominance of the test-taker. The test seems very formal and involves a mixture of verbal and non-verbal tasks. Your friend has performed the test and one of the results indicated that they have no musical ability because of their dominant left hemisphere. List three key arguments that could be used to dispute this result.

Hemispheric lateralisation only shows that the majority of processing occurs in one hemisphere for a particular task. It is invalid to conject that someone has no musical ability because they are left hemisphere dominant as the processing occurs in both hemispheres. The test also is unlikely to be able to properly assess an individual over such a short period of time.
