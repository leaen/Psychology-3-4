#### What is the central nervous system?

The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord.

#### What are its main roles in mental processes and behaviour?

The CNS is the chief officer of the body's functions. It constantly regulates heartrate, breathing, digestion but also is responsible for perceiving information from the sense (sent from the peripheral nervous system via the spinal cord) and responding to those inputs by sending back motor signals for muscles.

#### What are the main functions of the cerebral cortex?

The cerebral cortex provides most of the functionality for higher-order thinking and processing. This includes perception, language, learning, memory, thinking and problem-solving. It is also responsible for the planning and signalling of movements, such as writing and running.

#### Where is the cerebral cortex located?

The cerebral cortex is located in the 2-4mm thick convoluted and folding layer around the outside of the brain.

#### Of what does the cerebral cortex mainly consist?

Neurons

#### Name the three different categories of cortical areas and briefly describe the functions performed by each of these areas.

The motor cortex
The visual cortex
The auditory cortex

#### Describe the relationship between the size of the cerebral cortex and the mental capabilities of an organism.

Generally, there is a positive correlation between the size of the cerebral cortex in an organism and its abilities. That is to say a larger cerebral cortex in proportion to the rest of the organisms body, suggests greater intellgence.

#### What is a cerebral hemisphere?

The cerebral hemisphere are the two nearly identical halves of the brain, seperated by the longitudinal fissure.

#### Briefly describe three key characteristics that the cerebral hemispheres have in common.

Each of the hemispheres contains a motor, visual and auditory cortex. The locations of these corticies are also mirrored in the hemispheres. Both hemispheres also receive information from the opposing side of the body.

---

#### Name the deep groove that appears to seperate the hemispheres.

Longitudinal fissure.

---

#### What is the corpus callosum?

The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve tissue that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain.

#### Where is the corpus callosum located?

Along the longitudinal fissure below the frontal lobe. (?)

#### What key function is performed by the corpus callosum?

The corpus callosum is the major interconnect between the two cerebral hemispheres and relays information from one side of the brain to the other.

---

#### Suggest the possible impact on mental processes and behaviour if the corpus callosum were to be cut in tow and it was no longer an intact 'bridge'. Explain your answer.

Without the corpus callosum, the two cerebral hemispheres would be unable to properly communicate. As a result, functioning that requires information from both hemispheres would be unable to occur. This includes but is not limited to coordination in visual processing, some perceptions, and impaired motor control.

##### Construct a table that summarises the major functions of each lobe. Ensure that you name the main structures and areas, and include key functions of relevant sensory, motor, association and language areas.

##### Frontal lobe
- Primary mortex cortex
  * Responsible for the control of voluntary movements
  * Contralateral organisation (left hemisphere controls right side of body and vice versa)

- Broca's area
  * Responsible for the production of speech
  * Found in the left hemisphere for 95% of patients
  * Damage to this area leads to difficulty in forming grammarical structure (Broca's aphasia)
  * Comprehension and understanding of words remains unaffected when damaged

- Association areas
  * Prefrontal cortex
  * Receives and combines information from within the frontal lobe and other lobes to plan and execute more complex tasks
  * Control of emotion, expression of emotion

##### Parietal lobe
- Primary somatosensory cortex
  * Responsible for receiving somatosensory information from the peripheral nervous system via the spinal cord
  * Somatosensory information includes touch, temperature, pressure on the skin, position of muscles

- Association areas
  * Ability to sense our bodys position in space by combining information about the position of muscles and joints and information from the primary visual cortex

##### Temporal lobe
- Primary auditory cortex
  * Responsible for processing features of sound such as frequency and amplitute
  * Music is processed in different areas of the primary auditory cortex due to changes in frequency and amplitute

- Medial temporal lobe
  * Contains the hippocampus and amygdala
  * Crucial for long-term memory formation

- Wernicke's area
  * Located just above the primary auditory cortex usually in the left hemisphere
  * Required in order to process auditory cues of language (i.e speech)
  * Damage to this area leads to difficulty in forming coherency in speech, although words themselves are still clear (Wernicke's aphasia or fluent aphasia)
  * Pitch, tone and rate of speech still sound normal
  * Key content is left out and instead substituted with nonsense

- Association areas
  * Receiving, processing and storing memories of facts (semantic memories)
  * Personal experiences such as a party or birthday (episodic memories)
  * Visual perception, e.g identifying shapes and objects

##### Occipital lobe
- Primary visual cortex
  * Responsible for the processing of visual information sent from photoreceptors in the eyes
  * Located at the very back of the occipital lobe
  * The left visual field is processed in the right occipital lobe and vice versa

- Association areas
  * Communication with other areas to form visual memories, process writing
  * Essential for spacial reasoning

Following a head injury sustained in a car accident, Sofia is unable to feel any sensation of touch or temperature in an area on the left side of her face between her cheeks and her lower jaw. Fortunately Sofia did not damage her spine.

#### Which brain area is likely to be affected?

The somatosensory cortex is most likely to have been damaged as Sofia is having difficulty receives somatosensory information from her face such as the sensation of touch and temperature of her skin.

#### In which lobe is this area located?

The somatosensory cortex is located in the parietal lobe.
