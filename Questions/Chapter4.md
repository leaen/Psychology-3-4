#### What is the central nervous system?

The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord.

#### What are its main roles in mental processes and behaviour?

The CNS is the chief officer of the body's functions. It constantly regulates heartrate, breathing, digestion but also is responsible for perceiving information from the sense (sent from the peripheral nervous system via the spinal cord) and responding to those inputs by sending back motor signals for muscles.

#### What are the main functions of the cerebral cortex?

The cerebral cortex provides most of the functionality for higher-order thinking and processing. This includes perception, language, learning, memory, thinking and problem-solving. It is also responsible for the planning and signalling of movements, such as writing and running.

#### Where is the cerebral cortex located?

The cerebral cortex is located in the 2-4mm thick convoluted and folding layer around the outside of the brain.

#### Of what does the cerebral cortex mainly consist?

Neurons

#### Name the three different categories of cortical areas and briefly describe the functions performed by each of these areas.

The motor cortex
The visual cortex
The auditory cortex

#### Describe the relationship between the size of the cerebral cortex and the mental capabilities of an organism.

Generally, there is a positive correlation between the size of the cerebral cortex in an organism and its abilities. That is to say a larger cerebral cortex in proportion to the rest of the organisms body, suggests greater intellgence.

#### What is a cerebral hemisphere?

The cerebral hemisphere are the two nearly identical halves of the brain, seperated by the longitudinal fissure.

#### Briefly describe three key characteristics that the cerebral hemispheres have in common.

Each of the hemispheres contains a motor, visual and auditory cortex. The locations of these corticies are also mirrored in the hemispheres. Both hemispheres also receive information from the opposing side of the body.

---

#### Name the deep groove that appears to seperate the hemispheres.

Longitudinal fissure.

#### What is the corpus callosum?

The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve tissue that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain.

#### Where is the corpus callosum located?

Along the longitudinal fissure below the frontal lobe. (?)

#### What key function is performed by the corpus callosum?

The corpus callosum is the major interconnect between the two cerebral hemispheres and relays information from one side of the brain to the other.

---

#### Suggest the possible impact on mental processes and behaviour if the corpus callosum were to be cut in tow and it was no longer an intact 'bridge'. Explain your answer.

Without the corpus callosum, the two cerebral hemispheres would be unable to properly communicate. As a result, functioning that requires information from both hemispheres would be unable to occur. This includes but is not limited to coordination in visual processing, some perceptions, and impaired motor control.
