#### What is the central nervous system?

The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord.

#### What are its main roles in mental processes and behaviour?

The CNS is the chief officer of the body's functions. It constantly regulates heartrate, breathing, digestion but also is responsible for perceiving information from the sense (sent from the peripheral nervous system via the spinal cord) and responding to those inputs by sending back motor signals for muscles.

#### What are the main functions of the cerebral cortex?

The cerebral cortex provides most of the functionality for higher-order thinking and processing. This includes perception, language, learning, memory, thinking and problem-solving. It is also responsible for the planning and signalling of movements, such as writing and running.

#### Where is the cerebral cortex located?

The cerebral cortex is located in the 2-4mm thick convoluted and folding layer around the outside of the brain.

#### Of what does the cerebral cortex mainly consist?

Neurons

#### Name the three different categories of cortical areas and briefly describe the functions performed by each of these areas.

The motor cortex
The visual cortex
The auditory cortex

#### Describe the relationship between the size of the cerebral cortex and the mental capabilities of an organism.

Generally, there is a positive correlation between the size of the cerebral cortex in an organism and its abilities. That is to say a larger cerebral cortex in proportion to the rest of the organisms body, suggests greater intellgence.

# Learning Activity 4.2

#### What is a cerebral hemisphere?

The cerebral hemisphere are the two nearly identical halves of the brain, seperated by the longitudinal fissure.

#### Briefly describe three key characteristics that the cerebral hemispheres have in common.

Each of the hemispheres contains a motor, visual and auditory cortex. The locations of these corticies are also mirrored in the hemispheres. Both hemispheres also receive information from the opposing side of the body.

---

#### Name the deep groove that appears to seperate the hemispheres.

Longitudinal fissure.

---

#### What is the corpus callosum?

The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve tissue that connects the left and right hemispheres of the brain.

#### Where is the corpus callosum located?

Along the longitudinal fissure below the frontal lobe. (?)

#### What key function is performed by the corpus callosum?

The corpus callosum is the major interconnect between the two cerebral hemispheres and relays information from one side of the brain to the other.

---

#### Suggest the possible impact on mental processes and behaviour if the corpus callosum were to be cut in tow and it was no longer an intact 'bridge'. Explain your answer.

Without the corpus callosum, the two cerebral hemispheres would be unable to properly communicate. As a result, functioning that requires information from both hemispheres would be unable to occur. This includes but is not limited to coordination in visual processing, some perceptions, and impaired motor control.

# Learning Activity 4.7

##### Construct a table that summarises the major functions of each lobe. Ensure that you name the main structures and areas, and include key functions of relevant sensory, motor, association and language areas.

##### Frontal lobe
- Primary mortex cortex
  * Responsible for the control of voluntary movements
  * Contralateral organisation (left hemisphere controls right side of body and vice versa)

- Broca's area
  * Responsible for the production of speech
  * Found in the left hemisphere for 95% of patients
  * Damage to this area leads to difficulty in forming grammarical structure (Broca's aphasia)
  * Comprehension and understanding of words remains unaffected when damaged

- Association areas
  * Prefrontal cortex
  * Receives and combines information from within the frontal lobe and other lobes to plan and execute more complex tasks
  * Control of emotion, expression of emotion

##### Parietal lobe
- Primary somatosensory cortex
  * Responsible for receiving somatosensory information from the peripheral nervous system via the spinal cord
  * Somatosensory information includes touch, temperature, pressure on the skin, position of muscles

- Association areas
  * Ability to sense our bodys position in space by combining information about the position of muscles and joints and information from the primary visual cortex

##### Temporal lobe
- Primary auditory cortex
  * Responsible for processing features of sound such as frequency and amplitute
  * Music is processed in different areas of the primary auditory cortex due to changes in frequency and amplitute

- Medial temporal lobe
  * Contains the hippocampus and amygdala
  * Crucial for long-term memory formation

- Wernicke's area
  * Located just above the primary auditory cortex usually in the left hemisphere
  * Required in order to process auditory cues of language (i.e speech)
  * Damage to this area leads to difficulty in forming coherency in speech, although words themselves are still clear (Wernicke's aphasia or fluent aphasia)
  * Pitch, tone and rate of speech still sound normal
  * Key content is left out and instead substituted with nonsense

- Association areas
  * Receiving, processing and storing memories of facts (semantic memories)
  * Personal experiences such as a party or birthday (episodic memories)
  * Visual perception, e.g identifying shapes and objects

##### Occipital lobe
- Primary visual cortex
  * Responsible for the processing of visual information sent from photoreceptors in the eyes
  * Located at the very back of the occipital lobe
  * The left visual field is processed in the right occipital lobe and vice versa

- Association areas
  * Communication with other areas to form visual memories, process writing
  * Essential for spacial reasoning

Following a head injury sustained in a car accident, Sofia is unable to feel any sensation of touch or temperature in an area on the left side of her face between her cheeks and her lower jaw. Fortunately Sofia did not damage her spine.

#### Which brain area is likely to be affected?

The somatosensory cortex is most likely to have been damaged as Sofia is having difficulty receives somatosensory information from her face such as the sensation of touch and temperature of her skin.

#### In which lobe is this area located?

The somatosensory cortex is located in the parietal lobe.

# Learning Activity 4.9

#### Explain the meaning of the term hemispheric specialisation (or laterialisation) in relation to the cerebral cortex

Each of the hemispheres of the cerebral cortex have a number of tasks that the majority of processing occurs within that hemisphere. These are called specialisations.

---

| --- | Left hemisphere | Right hemisphere |
| Cognitive functions | Processes sensory information from right side of the body | Processes sensory information from left side of the body |
| Behavioural functions | Controls right side of the body | Controls left side of the body |
| Non-verbal functions | --- | Specialisation in skills that do not require language, e.g spatial thinking, recognition of faces, appreciating music and art, creative thinking, daydreaming, processing facial expressions |
| Verbal functions | Broca's area, Wernicke's area | --- |
| Analytical functions | Specialisation in breaking tasks down into key parts, logical reasoning, maths, sequential tasks | --- |

---

#### Identify the hemisphere (left or right) that specialises in these cognitive and behavioural functions:

- Left hemisphere
  * Listening to someone speak
  * Applying logic in an argument
  * Working out if you have enough money for a holiday
  * Speaking on the telephone
  * Giving someone the correct change for their purchases
  * Working out when you have to get up in the morning to get to school on time
  * Raising your right hand to answer a question in class

- Right hemisphere
  * Appreciating the beauty of a forest
  * Kicking a football with the left foot
  * Daydreaming about being rich and famous
  * Judging whether a car will fit into a parking space
  * Finding your way around a maze
  * Working out the meaning of a grin on someone's face
  * Arranging a bouquet of flowers
  * Recognising classmates from an old class photo

- Not sure
  * Playing golf on a Wii
  * Playing scrabble on an iPad
  * Playing Angry Birds on a phone

#### A friend tells you about an internet test that determines hemispheric dominance of the test-taker. The test seems very formal and involves a mixture of verbal and non-verbal tasks. Your friend has performed the test and one of the results indicated that they have no musical ability because of their dominant left hemisphere. List three key arguments that could be used to dispute this result.

Hemispheric lateralisation only shows that the majority of processing occurs in one hemisphere for a particular task. It is invalid to conject that someone has no musical ability because they are left hemisphere dominant as the processing occurs in both hemispheres. The test also is unlikely to be able to properly assess an individual over such a short period of time.

# Learning Activity 4.10

The cartoon is inaccurate as it portrays specialisation of a hemisphere as being exclusive of the other. Both hemispheres have their own specialisations, and certainly in no case is there a 'no-brain person'.

# Learning Activity 4.12

#### Describe the two main functions of the spinal cord in terms of the types of messages that travel up and down its length, and the branch of the nervous system to which it connects.

The spinal cords main functions are to relay somatosensory information from the body to the brain, and relay messages from the brain to organs, muscles and other parts of the body. This communication is completed via the peripheral nervous system.

---

#### Describe the role played by the spinal cord in initiating certain types of reflex responses.

The spinal cord is able to respond to certain signals without processing in the brain.

#### Why is this considered to be an 'adaptive' or 'survival' role?

An adaptation to respond quicker to pain or danger occured by reducing the time necessary to respond as the spinal cord was closer and processed faster than the brain.

#### Give an example of a reflex response that you believe may *not* be involved in a spinal reflex arc. Explain your choice of example.

Reflexes like eye dilation are controlled via the brain while the spinal cord is not involved.

---

#### Explain why damage to the spinal cord results in loss of brain-body control

As the ability to transfer sensory information from the body and control muscle, internal organs and glands relies on the nerves in the spinal cord, when damage occurs, those pathways are impaired and leads to a loss of brain-body control.

# Learning Activity 4.13

#### How is aphasia defined?

Aphasia is defined as a condition in which speech is impaired.

#### Distinguish between fluent and nonfluent aphasia, with reference to examples of speech not used in the text.

With fluent aphasia, a patient tends to have no trouble in pronouncing words and speaking, but experiences difficulty in comprehending the contents of speech. The most common fluent aphasia is Wernicke's aphasia. This is contary to nonfluent aphasias like Broca's aphasia in which comprehension is retained but speech production is impaired.

#### Compare and contrast the differences between Broca's aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia

| | Broca's aphasia | Werenicke's aphasia |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sentence structure | Mainly verbs and nouns | Mostly function words |
| Example of sentence | "Catch train home now" | "I called mother on the TV and did not understand the door" |
| Speech patterns | Speech requires effort and is slow and drawn out | Speech is effortless |
| Meaningfulness of speech | Meaningful | Characeristically incoherent |
| Patient awareness | Patient is aware of condition | Patient is not aware of condition |
| Understanding of spoken/written word | Acceptable | Difficulty with both |
| Brain lobe | Frontal lobe | Temporal lobe |

#### What do studies of people with aphasia indicate about the roles of the different hemispheres in language?

The left hemisphere is the primary processing area for language production and comprehension.

Olivia has recently suffered serious head injuries as a result of a car accident. Apparent effects of her injury are in her use of speech and her comprehension of speech. While she strings lengthy sentences together, they make little sense. Likewise, she seems to have great difficulty making sense of what others say.

#### Identify the brain area and brain lobe likely to be damaged and the cause of Olivia's speech problems.

Wernicke's area which is located in the Temporal lobe.

#### Explain the role this area plays in people whose brains are not affected by stroke, injury or disease.

When unaffected by stroke, injury or disease, Wernicke's area is responsible for the cognition of speech and language. It interprets the sound of talking and sight of written words and yields comprehension.

---

Following a stroke, Carlo's speech consisted of very short sentences that were incoherent. For example, the sentences were often made up of a few nouns and verbs that weren't linked properly.

#### Identify the brain area and brain lobe likely to be damaged and the cause of Carlo's speech problems.

Broca's area which is located in the Frontal lobe.

#### Explain the role this area plays in people whose brains are not affected by stroke, injury or disease.

When unaffected by stroke, injury or disease, Broca's area is responsible for the control of the facial muscles that produce speech. When Broca's area is damaged, the ability to pronounce language is impaired as a result of the difficulty to control the mouth.

# Learning Activity 4.14

#### Explain what spatial neglect is with reference to examples of mental processes and behaviour associated with the disorder.

Spatial Neglect is an attentional disorder in which the person affected systematically ignores stimuli on one side. It is common to observe patients affect by spatial neglect as completely ignoring people, objects and events that occur on one side of their visual field (usually the left visual field). Patients my greet only those on their right, or only be able to recall details on the right side of buildings.

#### Give an example of a visual scene that may be reported by an individual with spatial neglect when watching a sports event. The person's spatial neglect is limited to vision. Your example should identify the event and the position where the scene is viewed.

When the patient is seated facing the goals at a soccer game, their position along the row may affect the perceived size of the field. When seated in the middle of the row, the field will appear a similar size as it is really is. However when seated further to the right the perceived size of the field will decrease as less of the field is in the right visual field.

---

#### Which brain area is most commonly associated with spatial neglect?

The right pareital lobe.

#### What does this suggest about the role of that brain area?

This association suggests that the pareital lobe and the right hemisphere of the brain are largely responsible for the processing and attention of spatial information.

---

#### In what way does spatial neglect affect conscious experiences of people with the disorder?

Those with the disorder are unable to understand or be aware of the concept of 'left'. They may also struggle with motor direction (i.e moving muscles to the 'left'). Patients are also unaware of their condition (anosognosia).

---

#### Identify the IV and DV(s) in the experiment conducted by Bisach and Luzzatti (1978) and state these as operational variables.

- IV - Whether or not an individual has spatial neglect as a result of damage to the right pareital lobe.
- DV - A judgement of memory as measured by a description of popular Milan landmark.

#### In what way do the researcher's results suggest that spatial neglect does not involve memory impairment?

Patients are able to remember details of the objects they recall however these are usually limited to the right side of the object. This suggests that it is not a limitation of memory that is the cause but another factor (spatial neglect).

# Learning Activity 4.16

#### What is split-brain surgery and why is it performed?

Split-brain surgery is surgery that inolves the cutting of the corpus callosum. It may be performed for relief from conditions like epilepsy.

#### What is a split-brain study and why is it conducted?

Split-brain studies are studies on individuals who have their corpus callosum's cut. They are conducted in order to study the hemispheres of the brain seperately.

#### Why is each participant required to focus on a dot in the middle of the screen before the picture appears on the screen?

To ensure that the visual fields line up with the middle of the screen.

#### Describe what happens when a split-brain patient is flashed pictures of objects to the right hemisphere and asked to name them.

The pictures will be flashed in the left visual field and received on the left side of the retina. The right occipital lobe will then process the visual information. The patient will find themseles unable to named the object as the language processing required to name objects is unable to be accomplished as the visual information cannot travel to the left hemisphere of the brain.

#### What conclusion(s) did Sperry draw about how the hemispheres work in a 'normal' brain?

- The hemisphers communicate via the corpus callosum.
- The left hemisphere is the key hemisphere in language processing and speech.

---

#### What do split-brain studies indicate about ...
##### cognitive process of the brain?

The research suggests that the hemispheres may have different specialisations.

##### consciousness?

The research suggests that consciousness may be the sum of the experiences from each hemisphere and not from one viewpoint.

---

A doctor injects a sedative drug into the artery leading to your left hemisphere just before a friend visits you in hospital.

#### In what way(s) would you be able to greet your friend?

You would be able to wave to them with your right arm and smile at them.

#### What abilities normally used to greet someone would you be unable to use?

You would find yourself unable to greet them verbally, as language processing and speech production would be impaired as a result of the left hemisphere being sedated.

# Learning Activity 4.17

#### Define the meaning of each of the following ethical principles or practices and explain their relevance in the conduct of psychological research on the brain:

###### Protection and security of participant confidentiality

Results and personal information of participant's must not be released by the researcher's under any circumstances.

###### Voluntary participation

Participants must not be placed under any pressure to involve themselves in a study and must be completely free to reject their place.

###### Informed consent

All participants involved in the research must fully understand the purpose and process of the research. Then, the participant or a suitable legal guardian, must give written consent to the researchers.

###### Integrity

Researchers conducting a study must be committed to performing ethically during all stages of the research.

###### Respect for persons

The researcher is responsible for showing that the welfare, beliefs and rights of the patient have all been respected by the study. This includes the right to withdraw from an experiment, the right to confidentiality, ensuring that the patient understands the experiment (informed consent) and the need for a unabridged debrief following the study.

###### Beneficence

The 'payoff' or benefits of research when compared to the possible harm or discomfort caused to patients must be maximized.

###### Justice

The researcher has a reponsiblity to ensure there is a fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of the research, i.e there is no disadvantaging of a specific population.

A researcher plans to conduct an EEG study on patterns of electrical activity in the brain that are associated with tasks involving thinking (e.g solving arithmetic and word problems) as compared with voluntary movements (e.g wiggling the toes, rotating the knee, walking on a treadmill). The research proposes to copmare responses of two groups of participants: people with brain damage to the left hemisphere and people with brain damage to the right hemisphere.

All the brain-damaged participants have been used by the researcher as participants in two previous brain studies (unrelated to the proposed study) and are readily accessible because they reside in special-care accommodation close to the university where the researcher lectures on neuropsychology.

The researcher does not expect any difficulties in obtaining informed consent from the participants' spouses and legal guardians. The researcher expects that the study will advance understanding of hemispheric functioning because the EEG has newly developed electrodes that are renowned for their exceptional sensitivity. The study also provides an opportunity to use the improved EEG technology and possibly refine the technique further.

##### Analyse the ethical acceptability of the proposed study, with reference to each of the thical principles or practices considered above. Comment on whether the proposed study is ethically acceptable in relation to each ethical principle. Give reasons for your judgements.
