Learned behaviour

# Learning Activity 10.2

#### Define the meaning of the term learning.

Learning is a relatively permanent change in behaviour that occurs as a result of experience.

#### Briefly describe three key characteristics of behaviour that is learned.

- Change in behaviour
- Relatively permanent
- It is a result of experience

---

#### Differentiate between a learned response, a reflex action, a fixed-action pattern and behaviour depdent on maturation and give an example of each.

In a learned response, an individual changes their behaviour as a result of experience.
In a reflex action, the behaviour is an inborn automatic response which occurs the same way every time in response to a stimulus.
In a fixed-action pattern, there is a inborn predisposition to act in a certain way in response to a stimulus, which is characteristic to a species or group.
In behaviour dependent on maturation, a change in behaviour occurs as a result of genetically predetermined progressions.

---

Similing, laughing and crying are all observed in deaf-blind children who cannot have learned these responses by seeing or hearing them in others. Normally, each of these behaviours is seen within several months after birth. Some psychologists view this as evidence of fixed-action patterns in humans and suggest that these behaviours are programmed by our genetic inheritance.

#### Do you agree or disagree with this view? Why?

These are not limited to just humans, it is more appropriate to class this as behaviour dependent on maturation.

#### Can someone learn to control a reflex response? If so, give an example and explain your answer.

No, reflex responses occur involuntarily and are under the control of the autonomic nervous system.
