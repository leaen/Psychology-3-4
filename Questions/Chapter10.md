# Learning Activity 10.2

#### Define the meaning of the term learning.

Learning is a relatively permanent change in behaviour that occurs as a result of experience.

#### Briefly describe three key characteristics of behaviour that is learned.

- Change in behaviour
- Relatively permanent
- It is a result of experience

---

#### Differentiate between a learned response, a reflex action, a fixed-action pattern and behaviour depdent on maturation and give an example of each.

In a learned response, an individual changes their behaviour as a result of experience.
In a reflex action, the behaviour is an inborn automatic response which occurs the same way every time in response to a stimulus.
In a fixed-action pattern, there is a inborn predisposition to act in a certain way in response to a stimulus, which is characteristic to a species or group.
In behaviour dependent on maturation, a change in behaviour occurs as a result of genetically predetermined progressions.

---

Similing, laughing and crying are all observed in deaf-blind children who cannot have learned these responses by seeing or hearing them in others. Normally, each of these behaviours is seen within several months after birth. Some psychologists view this as evidence of fixed-action patterns in humans and suggest that these behaviours are programmed by our genetic inheritance.

#### Do you agree or disagree with this view? Why?

These are not limited to just humans, it is more appropriate to class this as behaviour dependent on maturation.

#### Can someone learn to control a reflex response? If so, give an example and explain your answer.

No, reflex responses occur involuntarily and are under the control of the autonomic nervous system.

# Learning Activity 10.4

#### Describe the most prominent changes that occur at the neuronal level when learning occurs.

When learning occurs, synapses are strengthened by the release of neurotransmitters from the pre-synaptic neuron to the post-synaptic neuron. Repeated firing between the neurons leads the post-synaptic neuron to become more sensitive the the pre-synaptic neuron. Additionally, when learning occurs, new synapses between neurons are formed, also strengthening the neural pathway making it easier for the pathway to fire again in the future.

#### Outline the roles glutamate and dopamine have in learning.

Glutamate when released during learning initiates activity in the post-synaptic neuron and is believed to contribute to synaptic formation and the strengthening of existing synapses.

Dopamine is also believed to play a role in learning but is more often researched for its function in the pleasure system. When released dopamine provides a pleasurable feeling, which is useful for reward-based learning.

#### Why is LTP believed to be a crucial biological process for learning to occur?

LTP allows neural pathways to become more sensitive and fire more often which in turn allows for learning to occur. Without LTP, the pathways that represent a change in behaviour would not fire, and the original behaviour would persist.

---

#### Explain the meaning of 'neural pathway of learning'

Neural pathways are what cause our behaviour and as a result for learning to occur neural pathways must change to accomodate a change in behaviour.

#### Learning has been described as a process of modifying existing pathways or building new neural pathways. Comment on the accuracy of this description.

This is mostly accurate, however it is also important to note that the disuse of existing pathways often results in the loss of sensitivity or weakening of synaptic connections.

---

#### Suggest a reason to explain why neural mechanisms of learning and memory are so alike that it can be difficult to isolate and differentiate between them.

Memory and learning both relate to changes that are caused by previous experiences. It can become difficult to distinguish between the two as inherently linked as you learn from your memories of events.

# Learning Activity 10.5

#### Aim:

To determine the effects of a stimulating environment on brain growth in rats.

#### Hypothesis:

It was hypothesised that rats who lived in a more stimulating environment would exhibit more brain growth than those who were in a standard condition or an environment with less than normal stimulation.

#### Operationalised variables:

IV: Whether a rat was placed into the impoverished environment, control or enriched environment.
DV: The weight of the rats brains and the number of synapses.

#### Different conditions of experiment:

Impoverished condition: A single rat alone in a standard cage
Control condition: Three rats in a standard cage
Enriched condition: Ten-twelve rats in a larger cage with new stimuli added daily

#### Experimental design:

Independent groups.

#### Procedure of allocation:

Random allocation.

#### Results:

It was found that rats from the enriched group showed the most brain development while rats from the impoverished group showed the least brain development.

#### Conclusion:

Living in a stimulating environment promotes the development of new neural pathways and strengthens existing neural pathways.

# Learning Activity 10.6

#### Explain the meaning of plasticity in relation to the brain.

Plasticity refers to the ability of the brain's neural structure to change and adapt as a result of experience throughout the lifespan.

#### Explain why the brain is considered to have plasticity with reference to two key points.

The brain changes during adolescence (developmental plasticity) and can repair damage caused by trauma due to brain injury (adaptive plasticity).

#### Explain the meaning of developmental plasticity with reference to learning

Developmental plasticity refers to learning that occurs according to progression along a maturational schedule of development.

#### In what way do synaptogenensis and synaptic pruning demonstrate the plasticity of the brain?

In the initial years of a child's life, synaptogenesis (the formation of new synapses) causes the brain to become overloaded with neurons. The brain then removes these neurons (synaptic pruning) causing the brain to change its function by discarding neurons which are not needed.

---

#### What is adaptive plasticity?

Adaptive plasticity refers to changes made to the brain's neural structure in order to recover from trauma caused by brain injury.

#### In what way is adaptive plasticity similar to and different from developmental plasticity?

Both adaptive plasticity and developmental plasticity can account for a change in the function and structure of neurons and can also repair damage to the brain. However, developmental plasticity occurs in the period from birth until the end of adolescence whereas adaptive plasticity remains for the whole lifespan.

#### Describe three neural processes that indicate and enable adaptive plasticity.

- Rerouting, in which undamaged neurons who have lost connections with damaged neurons find new neurons to connect with.
- Sprouting, in which the growth of new bushier nerve fibres with more branches to make connections occurs.
- Synaptogenesis? It seems more like there is only two neural processes

---

#### Give an example of research findings that support the occurrence of adaptive plasticity in response to everyday experience

Adults who learnt to juggle were found to have their hippocampal area grow during the time they were learning to juggle when compared to a control group.

#### Give an example of research findings that support the occurrence of adaptive plasticity in response to recovery from brain damage

A successful piano player who lost control of her right hand as a result of damage caused by a stroke to the left hemisphere regained control of her right hand after several months of rehabilitation.

---

#### Explain how adaptive plasticity enables compensation for lost brain function and/or maximises remaining functions in the event of brain damage

After serious trauma occurs the brain will reorganise itself in order to compensate for the lost function. If a finger is lost for example, the neurons which were previously used to receive sensory information for that finger will over time become more sensitive to sensory input from other fingers, maximising the usefulness of that area of neural matter.

---

#### In what way is the 'timing of experiences' relevant to brain plasticity for learning?

Depending on the amount an individual has progressed through their maturational schedule, learning can occur either more easily or more difficultly.

#### Distinguish between sensitive periods and critical periods for learning with reference to two key points and a relevant example of each concept.

Sensitive periods are periods during which the brain is more responsive to learning and undergo more changes whereas critical periods are periods during which the development will not progress in a normal way unless experience occurs.

An example of a sensitive period is humans will be able to learn language with the most ease up until the ages 12 years.

An example of a critical period is during the first 5 years of life is when the visual cortex is most vulnerable to deprivation of visual experiences.

#### Distinguish between experience-expectant learning and experience-dependent learning with reference to an example.

Experience-expectant learning that takes place due to an experience which is expected by the brain. If such an experience does not occur when expected then brain development may not occur as it should. This includes the learning of language and visual stimulation.

Experience-dependent learning refers to learning that requires exposure to a particular experience at any time in an individual's development. This includes learning the piano, cooking.
