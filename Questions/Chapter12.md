#### Explain the meaning of the term normality with reference to an example.

Normality can be defined as a pattern of thoughts, feelings or behaviour that conforms to a usual, typical or expected standard. What is considered normal may also be different depending on the cultural norms of an area.

#### Describe two examples not used in the text of normal behaviour in Australian society that may be considered abnormal in another society

Talking at the dinner table is considered to be unruly behaviour in Buddhist monk circles, and thus abnormal in a different society.

People in Australia often throw away whatever food is left over after eating dinner, in some of the poorer African countries this is considered abnormal as there is often not much food to eat.

#### Describe two examples not used in the text of normal behaviour in a cultural group within Australian society that may be considered abnormal by another cultural group in Australia

Within aboriginal groups in Australia it is considered normal to rub clay paints onto your body in patterns and dance around a fire, societal groups living in the central business district would however consider this very abnormal behaviour.

Primarily Asian parts of Australia find it normal to eat a wider variety of meats such as cats, bats, and birds whereas in those living the CBD may classify that as abnormal behaviour.

#### Explain the meaning of the term abnormality with reference to an example.

Abnormality is any set of thoughts, feelings or behaviours that would not be typically exhibited in someone who is normal.

Before leaving his house, Alessio checks that all the electrical appliances are unplugged (because he thinks they might start a fire while he's out), that all the taps are completely turned off (because he thinks they might flood his house while he's out) and that all the doors and windows are properly secured (because he thinks someone might break in while he's out). On a couple of occasions, Alessio has made several journeys back and forth to his home to check that things are as they should be, because he had a 'niggling doubt' that his first check was not done properly. Alessio's 'checking behaviour consumes several hours of his day and it has got to the point where he has been late for work so often that he's just been dismissed. The situation between Alessio and his girlfriend is also strained. Alessio's girlfriend reports that 'he has no time for me anymore'. Alessio wants to stop having to 'check' things all the time, but if he doesn't do it, he experiences so much anxiety that he is nearly physically sick.

#### Consider the following description of Alessio and explain whether his thoughts, feelings and behaviour are normal with reference to the socio-cultural, medical and statistical approaches to defining normality.

Alessio's thoughts, feeling and behaviour are abnormal within modern Australian culture, classifying his thoughts as abnormal by the historical approach. His compulsive checking of his house for disaster was responsible for the loss of his job, classifying his behaviour as abnormal by the functional approach. By the situational approach, there is no reason to cause him to act in the way he does (e.g a rise in the number of burglaries in his area) and therefore his behaviour and thoughts can be considered abnormal. By the medical approach there is no clear biological cause for his behaviour, and can therefore be considered normal based on his biological state. From the statistical approach a vast minority of people exhibit such behaviour and therefore is abnormal.

#### Explain the meaning of mental health with reference to examples of the thinking, feeling and behaviour of a mentally healthy person.

Mental health is the capacity of an individual to interact with others and the environment in ways that promote subjective wellbeing, optimal development throughout the lifespan and effective use of the person's cognitive, emotional and social abilities.

#### Explain the meaning of mental illness with reference to an example that illustrates the key elements of the definition, but not an example used in the text.

A mental illness is a psychological disorder that significantly interferes with an individual's cognitive, emotional and or social abilities.

#### What are the differences between a mental health problem and a mental illness?

Mental health problems typically are much less severe and shorter in duration whereas mental illness tend to be longer in duration.

#### Does abnormal behaviour necessarily indicate the presence of mental illness? Explain your answer.

Not necessarily, as behaviour that is considered abnormal with respect to traditional societal norms may still be considered normal so long as it's typical to that person.

#### Distinguish between mental health and mental illness with reference to an example

Mental health refers to proper functioning and the ability to go throughout the day without distress, anxiety or other difficulties whereas mental illness refers to a serious condition which disrupts the ability for someone to function normally, almost always accompanied with serious distress and anxiety.
