## Experimental design

The basic layout of a design is as follows.

1. Background information about the topic of the study is collected
2. A testable hypothesis is established
3. A suitable study sample is selected
4. The experimental procedures are completed
5. Measurements of the different conditions are made
6. Interpretation of the data and conclusions

## Introduction of biases in experiments

Biases are unintentional effects that can cause a change in the DV. Without proper control of biases, it is difficult and invalid to draw correct conclusions from the results of an experiment. Biases in experiments can be introduced at any stage of the design of an experiment, although they are mostly introduced while conducting experimental procedures and when collecting and interpreting results.

### Placebo effect

The placebo effect refers to the influence of an individual's belief that they are being experimented on, on the measured DV. While this is purely an affect on the participants mind, it can be surprisingly powerful.

Psychosomatic illnesses are illnesses that have physical symptoms that originate from entirely psychological causes.


### Sample bias

A sample bias is introduced when some members of a population are less likely to be represented in a sample than others.

An example of a sample bias is when researching the prevalence of binge-drinking in Australian youth, only selecting a sample from a posh private school in Toorak.

Sample biases can be controlled by gathering a large population, and ensuring that a sample taking for experimentation is representative of that population (by using random-stratified sampling)
