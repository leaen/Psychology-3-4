## States of consciousness
### Consciousness

*Consciouness* - Consciousness is the awareness of objects and events in the external world and of our own existence and mental experiences at any given moment.

#### The conscious experience can be described in the following ways:

- Personal - Consciousness contains an individuals sense of self, and as a result is highly subjective and personal to each person.
- Selective - Since you may voluntarily shift your focus away from certain things, the consciousness experience can be described as selective
- Continuous - Consciousness can never be empty or nil
- Changing - New information is constantly pouring into mind, leading it to new conclusions and views

### States of consciousness

#### Qualities of states of consciousness include:
##### Level of awareness
Attention is a concentration of mental activity that involves focusing on a specific stimulus while ignoring other stimuli. This concerntration may be focussed internally (such as on thoughts and feelings) or externally (such as on a person you're talking to). Shifts in attention can be both intentional and unintentional. For example you may intentionally stop reading a book and instead go watch TV (intentional change), or your phone may ring while you're studying (unintentional change). As level of awareness is a criterion for a state of consciousness, as your level of awareness changes, your conscious awareness changes.

Generally, there are two levels of awareness:

###### Selective attention
Selective attention involves choosing and attending to a specific stimulus to the exclusion of others. It is generally associated with tasks that are complex or require a large amount of cognitive effort. Examples include learning to driving or a comprehension on a story just read to you. Selective attention is required for any controlled process.

When a stimulus is determined to be personally important to us, we are more likely to notice it. An example of this behaviour in action is the 'cocktail party effect'. If you are at a party with loud music and talking to a group of friends, you may find your attention suddenly change when you hear someone say your name in a different conversation.

###### Divided attention
Divided attention refers to the ability to distribute our attention and undertake two or more activites simulatenously. It is the attention associated with activites that can be multi-tasked, or anything that requires a low level of cognitive effort. Examples of activites that can be completed with divided attention include walking, talking and driving (if already an experienced driver).

##### Content limitations
Content limitations refer to the ability for individuals to selectively restrict what is let into the content of their consciousness. During NWC, you are typically able to restrict more content from your consciousness, whereas during an ASC you may not be able to block out as much content. For example when in an alcohol-induced state, an individual may not be able to block out feelings and emotions to the same degree as if they were in NWC, often leading them to experience more emotional outbursts.

##### Controlled processes
A controlled process involves conscious, alert awareness and mental effort in which the individual actively focuses their attention on achieving a particular goal. Controlled processes are often required for tasks that involve new experiences in which the brain is not as familar with.The flow of information can be described as _serial_ meaning that information much be processed one after another and not simultaneously. Controlled processes require high levels of cognitive effort to be dedicated to the task. Controlled processes include learning to drive, learning a new board game and rock climbing.

##### Automatic processes
An automatic process requires little conscious awareness and mental effort, minimal attention and does not interfere with the performance of other activities. Automatic processing is most often used for tasks that are familiar to an individual and that are completed often. The flow of information can be described as _parallel_ meaning that during automatic processing an individual may be able to complete two or more tasks simulatenously.

Automatic processing can be illustrated with the Stroop effect, in which participants are shown cards with coloured words on them. Participants are asked to read aloud the colour of each word. In cases where the colour of the word and the word itself are congruent, the participant responsed the quickest. In cases where there was a mismatch of colour and the word (e.g the word 'blue' in red ink) participants often took longer to respond and were incorrect more often. This shows that the automatic process of reading the word often completes quicker than the more complicated task of interpreting the colour of the word (a controlled process).

#### Characteristics of ASCs

##### Time orientation
Estimation and the 'feel' of time is often impaired during an ASC. Individuals may feel that time passes slower or more quickly than the rate at which real time progresses. For example when falling asleep you do not feel as if you have been asleep for several hours, instead you feel as if you were just awake before.

##### Emotional awareness
During ASCs, individuals may find themselves becoming more emotional or erractic in behaviour. They could feel less inhibited and show their emotions more. Unexpected or inappropriate emotional reactions such as laughing at the news that a family member may also occur. Quick swings in mood are also particularly common when in an alcohol-induced state, for example someone may become suddenly agressive for no apparent reason.

##### Perceptual and cognitive distortions
Perceptions and interpretations of surroundings may be distorted during an ASC. For example in a drug-induced state individuals may percieve inanimate objects as being alive and talking (hallucations). Individuals may lose the sense of who they are. ASCs may also enhance senses, making smells stronger, colours more vibrant etc. Cognitive functioning may also be impaired during an ASC, individuals may struggle to think in logical ways or become much less adept at problem-solving. Memory may be impaired.

##### Self-control
Individuals may struggle to stay standing upright or struggle with movements that require coordination such as walking in a straight line. They may become less controlled in their emotions and experience outbursts of sadness or anger. When in a hypnotic state, individuals may become more open to suggestion.

As level of awareness changes, different states of consciousness are able to be experienced. This is possible due to the changing aspect of the consciousness experience. Since level of awareness changes over a spectrum, states of consciousness can be generalised on a spectrum from total awareness (focussed attention, NWC) to a complete lack of awareness (anaesthesised state, unconcious).

#### Normal waking consciousness
Normal waking consciousness or NWC refers to the states of consciousness associated with being awake and aware of our thoughts, memories, feelings and the sensations we are experiencing from the outside world.

#### Altered states of consciousness
- Daydreaming
- Alcohol-induced state
- Sleep, "purpose of sleep, characteristics and patterns of the stages of sleep including rapid eye movement (REM) and the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stages of sleep" - vcaa

### Sleep

#### Purpose of sleep
The purpose of sleep is a topic in which there are two major theories. Restorative theories that propose that sleep is used to restore and repair the body and survial theories, which propose that sleep is used as a tool that was evolved to restrict activity during times of day when an animal may be more vulunerable.

There is limited evidence for both theories and there are no definite answers to the reasons fro sleep, although both theories provide insights for possiblities as to why we sleep.

##### Survival theories
Survival theories are also known as adaptive, evolutionary, preservation and protective theories. They revolve around the idea that while asleep animals are less likely to be spotted by predators when moving around. Once an organism has met all the needs for eating, drinking caring for its young, according to survival theories, it will spend the rest of the time inactive.

Supporting evidence for survival theories can be shown by the existing sleep patterns for various species and the characteristics of those species. For example, animals with fewer predators like lions and gorillas typically sleep longer (up to 15 hours). Animals which require more time to eat suffecient amounts of food like cattle and horses and are usually less agile will spend more time alert and awake (usually sleeping only 4 hours).

Considering this from a human perspective, it is possible that humans would sleep at night due to poor eyesight during the night. It may of been safer to sleep in a cave or under shelter than to attempt to find food.

##### Restorative theories
According to restorative theories, sleep proides an opportunity for the body to replenish the stores of energy that have been depleted during the day. However, recovery that takes place is not only physiologically but also psychological. The main physiological benefits occur during NREM sleep, while REM sleep is associated with psychological repair, including memory consolidation and continuing cognitive robustness.

Evidence for the physiological restorative nature of sleep can be given by Shapiro et al., 1981 which showed that ultra-marathon runners spent a extra 90 minutes asleep over a control group, and additionally tended to stay in slow wave sleep for a longer period of time.

methods used to study the level of alertness in normal waking consciousness and the stages of sleep:
- polysomnography

measurement of physiological responses including electroencephalograph (EEG), electromyograph (EMG), electro-oculargraph (EOG), heart rate, body temperature and galvanic skin response (GSR)
- eeg
- eog
- emg
- gsr

the use of sleep laboratories, video monitoring and self reports
the effects of total and partial sleep depreviation:
- loss of REM and NREM sleep
- sleep recovery patterns including amount of sleep required, REM rebound and microsleeps
- sleep-wake cycle shifts during adolescence compared with child and adult sleep including delayed onset of sleep and need for sleep

## Brain

### Structure of the brain

At the core of the brain is what is known as the old brain. While still used it is the most generic and oldest part of the brain still present in humans. The limbic system (also known as the midbrain), consisting of the amygdala and hippocampus, is responsible for the regulation of mood and memory consolidation. Finally the outermost layer of the brain is known as the cerebral cortex, and is the main distinguishing feature that differs humans from other animals.

For the purpose of studying and VCE the cerebral cortex is typically split up into four topological sections; the front, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes.

### Frontal lobe

#### Primary motor cortex

- Controls the muscles

#### Somatosensory cortex

- Deals with information concerning the senses

#### Broca's area
##### Broca's aphasia

- Caused by damage to broca's area
- Characterised by the impediment of production of speech
  * Speech lacks grammar
  * Predominantly nouns and verbs
- Comprehension can be impaired in some cases
- Affects ability with written grammar
- Simple words are much easier to say (e.g yes and no) as opposed to less used words

### Parietal lobe
### Occipital lobe

- The information from each retina gets split up sent to both hemispheres for processing.

#### Primary visual cortex

- Feature detector cells

#### Association area

- Interact with primary visual cortex
- Causes issues when audio is out of sync with visuals
- *Integrate* visual information with other information such as memory, language and sounds

### Temporal lobe

- Memory
- Aspects of visual perception such as ability to identify objects and recognise faces
- Emotional processing

#### Hippocampus
#### Amygdala
#### Primary auditory cortex

- RAI sounds from both ears
- Verbal sounds are primarlly processed in the left hemisphere
- Non-verbal sounds are primarlly processed in the right hemisphere

#### Association areas

- What things are, object, face recognition
- Determining appropriate responses to stimuli
- Episodic memory

#### Werenicke's area

- In 90% of people, Werenicke's area and Broca's area are both in the left hemisphere
- Responsible for attaching meaning to what you hear and say (comprehension)
- Damage to Werenicke's area can result in impediment in speech and listening skills

Grows more around age 12

Agenesis of the corpus callosum

#### Broca's aphasia vs. Werenicke's aphasia

| --- | Broca's aphasia | Werenicke's aphasia |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sentence structure | Mainly verbs and nouns | Mostly function words |
| Example of sentence | "Catch train home now" | "I called mother on the TV and did not understand the door" |
| Speech patterns | Speech requires effort and is slow and drawn out | Speech is effortless |
| Meaningfulness of speech | Meaningful | Characeristically incoherent |
| Patient awareness | Patient is aware of condition | Patient is not aware of condition |
| Understanding of spoken/written word | Acceptable | Difficulty with both |


### Split brain studies

### Hemispheric specialisation
#### Left hemisphere

- Verbal tasks
- Logical reasoning
- Controlling movements and receiving and processing sensations from the right side of the body
- Analysis of information

#### Right hemisphere

- Non-verbal tasks
- Thinking holistically globally
- Processing spatial information
- Emotion recognition
- Understanding metaphors and abstract concepts
- Controlling movements and receiving and processing sensations from the left side of the body


Example question: Name one specialiation of the left hemisphere of the brain.
→ Controlling the movements and receiving the sensations from the right side of the body.
→ This is the *least* controversial answer, and therefore the hardest to argue against.
