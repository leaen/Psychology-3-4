# Mind, Brain and body

## Outcome 1

### Key knowledge
#### concepts of normal waking consciousness and altered states of consciousness including daydreaming and alcohol-induced, in terms of levels of awareness, content limitations, controlled and automatic processes, perceptual and cognitive distortions, emotional awareness, self-control and time orientation
#### sleep as an altered state of consciousness: purpose of sleep, characteristics and patterns of the stages of sleep including rapid eye movement (REM) and the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stages of sleep
#### methods used to study the level of alertness in normal waking consciousness and the stages of sleep:
##### measurement of physiological responses including electroencephalograph (EEG), electromyograph (EMG), electro-oculargraph (EOG), heart rate, body temperature and galvanic skin response (GSR)
##### the use of sleep laboratories, video monitoring and self reports
##### the effects of total and partial sleep depreviation:
###### loss of REM and NREM sleep
###### sleep recovery patterns including amount of sleep required, REM rebound and microsleeps
###### sleep-wake cycle shifts during adolescence compared with child and adult sleep including delayed onset of sleep and need for sleep
##### the interaction between cognitive processes of the brain and its structure including:
###### roles of the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system (somatic and autonomic), and autotonomic nervous system (sympathetic and parasympathetic)
###### roles of the four lobes of the cerebral cortex in the control of motor, somatosensory, visual and auditory processing in humans; primary cortex and association areas
###### hemispheric specialisation: the cognitive and behavioural functions of the right and left hemispheres of the cerebral cortex, non-verbal versus verbal and analytical functions
##### contribution of studies to the investigation of cognitive processes of the brain and implications for the understanding of consciousness including:
###### studies of aphasia including Broca’s aphasia and Wernicke’s aphasia
###### spatial neglect caused by stroke or brain injury
###### split-brain studies including the work of Roger Sperry and Michael Gazzaniga
##### research methodologies and ethical principles associated with the study of the brain and states of consciousness, as outlined in the introduction to Unit 3 on page 22.
