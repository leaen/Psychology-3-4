The Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory was designed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin in 1968. The model focusses on three major systems of memory - sensory, short-term and long-term. Each system interacts with others continually with each system having unique characteristics including storage capacity and storage duration.

#### Sensory memory

Storage capacity: Unlimited
Storage duration: 0.3 - 10 seconds

Sensory memory is split into three subsystems of memory. Iconic memory, echoic memory and haptic memory. **Iconic memory is memory of visual information**, from the visual cortex and visual processing areas. **Echoic memory refers to auditory memory** such as sounds being interpreted within the auditory cortex. **Haptic memory refers to touch and feeling** related memories from the somatosensory cortex.

Sensory memory can be encoded into short-term memory via **attention**.

#### Short-term memory

Storage capacity: 7 Â± 2 items
Storage duration: 18 - 20 seconds

#### Long-term memory

Storage capacity: Unlimited
Storage duration: Unlimited
