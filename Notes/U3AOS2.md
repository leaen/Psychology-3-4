# Memory

### Encoding, storage, retrieval

The three main processes of memory include encoding, storage, retrieval. Each step is required in order to obtain a working and useful form of memory.

**Encoding is the conversion of information into a useable form**. This can be considered analogous to a keyboard converting key presses into binary information.

**Storage refers to retainment of memory** over time. This can be considered analogous to a hard drive on a computer.

**Retrieval is the locating and recovering** of stored information.

## Models of memory

### Atkinson-Shiffrin's multi-store model of memory

![Information flow in the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Multistore_model.png)

The Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory was designed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin in 1968. The model focusses on three major systems of memory - sensory, short-term and long-term. Each system interacts with others continually with each system having unique characteristics including storage capacity and storage duration.

#### Sensory memory

Storage capacity: Unlimited
Storage duration: 0.3 - 10 seconds

Sensory memory is split into three subsystems of memory (called sensory registers). Iconic memory, echoic memory and haptic memory. Sensory memory is stored **within the sense organs** and **not the brain**.

**Iconic memory is memory of visual sensory memory**, from the retina. **Echoic memory refers to auditory sensory memory** like sounds heard by the ears. **Haptic memory refers to touch and feeling** that may be felt in the skin.

Sensory memory can be encoded into short-term memory via **attention**. If not attended to, information is simply filtered out of consciousness and forgotten.

#### Evidence of sensory memory

**Sperling (1960)** showed that participants were able to recall greater amounts of information than previously thought. A grid of letters was flashed by a tachistoscope in front of the participants, who were then asked to verbally report as many letters as possible. Most participants could only recall 4 or 5 of the letters.

Sperling then played a tone with a small delay after flashing the letters. The pitch of the tone indicated the row from which the participant should read out. It was observed that participants were able to do so accurately approximately 75% of the time, unlike what would be expected from the previous experiments.

This suggests that while iconic memory is unlimited in capcity, the duration is so short that by the time participants reach the 4th or 5th item, the rest are forgotten.

---

**Cowan et al. 2000)** asks participants to focus their attention on reading a story while a list of numbers is read aloud. Upon hearing a tone, participants were required to attempt to recall the numbers that they heard. As the delay between hearing numbers and the tone increased, the accuracy of recall reduced.

#### Comparison between types of sensory memory

| Type of memory | Memory duration | Memory capacity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Iconic memory | 0.2 - 0.4 seconds | Unlimited |
| Echoic memory | 3-4 seconds | Unlimited |
| Haptic memory | 9-10 seconds | Unlimited |

#### Short-term memory

Storage capacity: 7 ± 2 items
Storage duration: 18 - 20 seconds

Memories leave short term memory by either **displacement** or **decay**.

| Function | Capacity | Duration | Encoding | Forgetting | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recevies information from sensory memory; receives information from long-term memory; sending information to long-term memory | 7 ± 2 items | ~20 seconds | Mostly acoustic; Attention and rehersal will help store info in STM | Displacement and interference; Possibility of decay | --- |

#### Rehersal

##### Elaborative rehersal

Elaborative rehersal links information in a meaningfully way that **creates cues** to you locate and retrieve the memory later. It's a **more active** process than maintenance rehresal and uses a **'deeper' level of encoding** (refer to the Levels of processing theory).

Elaborative rehersal is the preferred method of rehersal to move memories from STM to LTM as it is **more effective** than maintenance rehersal.

##### Mainenance rehersal

Maintenance rehersal is the process of **repeating information** to yourself in order to remember it. This may be vocally (speaking the words aloud), sub-vocal (speaking words in your head), visualising (keeping an image in your head) or muscularly (imaging how it feels to perform an action). Once maintenance rehersal stops, the memory will typically be **lost after about 20 seconds**.

Maintenance rehersal is very helpful when trying to keep information in short term memory.

#### Long-term memory

Storage capacity: Potentially unlimited
Storage duration: Potentially permanent

Long-term memory works by linking memories to one another in a semantic web. Experiences are linked to other relevant memories. Retrieval cues allow memories to be *found*.

There are different types of memories stored in long term memory.

| Function | Capacity | Duration | Encoding | Forgetting | Example |
| --- | Potentially unlimited | Relatively premanent | Elaborative rehersal & maintenance rehersal | Incorrect cues, interference with other info, motivation, decay | --- |

##### Procedural (explicit) memory

**Procedural memory** refers to knowledge of **skills, habits or actions**. This may include simple motor skills such as being able to walk and ride a bike, to other things such as using a keyboard or brushing your teeth.

Procedural memories are **recalled without any conscious effort** and are called **implicit**.

#### Organisation of LTM

![Organisation of LTM](https://andrewharvey4.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/taxonomy_of_memory.png)

##### Declarative (explicit) memory

**Declarative memory** involves memory for **facts, events and general knowledge**. Typically, declarative memories are further split into two groups: semantic memories and episodic memories.

Declarative memories but be **explicitly** called upon to be retrieved.

###### Semantic memory

Semantic memory stores information about facts and general knowledge that is not tied to a single time, place or event. This includes knowledge about the world (e.g the sky is blue), formulae, general rules and other information not tied to a specific place/time.

###### Episodic memory

Episodic memory refers memories about a specific time or place that was personally experienced. This includes details on the time, place, psychological and physiological state, as well as when the event occured.

### Semantic network theory

![An example of a semantic network](http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-content/themes/ACT-R/tutorials/unit1_files/image004.gif)

The semantic network theory was first developed by Alan Collins in 1969. The theory contends that long-term memory is organised by **linking** different **concepts** (called nodes) in **meaningful** ways to form a **hierarchical structure** called a network.

When an individual needs to recall something, they begin by searching a 'region' of memory, and then follow cues until they remember the information they required. This theory is also not only efficient in terms of accesibility but also storage, as attributes shared between concepts do not need to be duplicated.

The length of links determine the relevance between topics. Typically the longer a link the longer the duration it takes for that information to be accessed.

#### Evidence for semantic network theory

Collin and Quillian (1969) (refer to slide 52 in Ong's notes)

#### Questions about semantic network theory

- Why might it be advantageous to organise memories semantically?
- How does elaborative rehersal relate to semantic network theory?

### Baddeley and Hitch's model of memory

Devleoped by Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch in 1974, the Baddeley and Hitch's model of memory focuses on the concept of **working memory** and describes a proposed structure and functioning of theorised components that make up working memory.

The 4 components that compose this model of memory are:
- Central executive
- Visuo-spatial sketchpad
- Phonological loop
- Episodic buffer

#### Central executive

The central executive is responsible for **selecting, inhibiting and updating** (SIU for short). Another role for the central executive is selecting what is placed into the episodic buffer for processing as well as the accessing of long-term memories to be placed into the episodic buffer (this is *not* a role of the episodic buffer).

#### Visuo-spatial sketchpad

The visuo-spatial sketchpad (also known as visual working memory) **temporarily stores s limited amount of visual and spatial information** for a brief period of time. **Manipulation of visual and spatial information** (such as rotating shapes around in your head or picturing your bedroom) occurs within the visuo-spatial sketchpad.

#### Phonological loop

The phonological loop (also known as verbal working memory) **temporarily stores a limited amount of verbal speech-like information** for a brief period of time. **Manipulation of auditory information** occurs within the phonological loop.

#### Episodic buffer

The episodic buffer acts as a workspace for the processing of information. **Integration** of different information occurs here.

#### Notes for answering questions

It is important to note when discussing components of Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch's model of memory that the components have an **active role** in memory. For example you may mention the manipulation of information within the phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad.

### Craik and Lockhart's levels of processing theory

Craik and Lockhart's levels of processing theory model of memory suggests that long-term memory is not a single store in which all information can be recalled equally well, but instead that some memories can be retrieved easier than others as a result of being more **deeply encoded**. Memory storage in other words is a **continuous dimension** in which memories are **encoded related to the ease of retrieval**.

Although memories are stored in a continuous dimension, the study design seperates memories into three general levels of encoding: shallow, moderate and deep.

Shallow memories are typically encoded based on their appearance or **structural encoding**. Examples relating to words are, "is the word written in uppercase", "does the word contain two consecutive o's". Shallow memories are typically **recalled the worst** out of all levels of encoding.

Moderate or intermediate memories are recalled based on their sound or **phonetic encoding**. A good example of moderate encoding is whether a word rhymes with another word. Moderately encoded memories are **not the best, but not the worst**.

Deeply encoded memories are learnt by their meaning or **semantic encoding**. This is by far the most effective method of learning content and has the deepest level of encoding. Examples of semantic encoding include how a word might fit into a sentence and what it means. Deeply encoded memories are **recalled the best of all**.

### Mnemonic devices

A **mnemonic device** is a **technique that is used to improve** the capacity or longevity of memory. They work by creating cues that aid recall or by adding meaningful links between pieces of information and what is already stored in LTM. Mnemonic devices **elaborate on information**, making it easier to locate and retrieve.

#### Acronyms

An **acronym is a shortened or abbreviated phrase** made into a **pronounceable** word. Examples of acronyms include NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), ANZAC (Australian New Zealand Army Corps) and ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).

Acronyms are often confused with initialisms such as NSA (National Security Agency), however the important distinction between the two is that acronyms are pronounceable whereas initialisms are not.

Acronyms aid memory by making each letter in the acronym a cue for recalling the next word in the phrase.

#### Acrostics

**Acrostics** are words formed by **taking the first letter** from a series of words and stringing them together to form a phrase. If trying to remember the letters T A L F, one might construct an acrostic that reads "That's a large flower".

Acrostics work in a similar way to acronyms in that each word acts as a due for recall.

#### Narrative chaining

Narrative chaining refers to the construction of a story that links items together in order to aid memory. If trying to remember the words [worm, bus, wings, kite, rock, egg], you might construct a tale that goes something like this. The worm biting onto a string connected to a kite was strapped onto a fast-moving bus veering out of control. The bus then crashed into a large rock, shattering all the eggs it carried.

Narrative chaining relies on the principles of elaborative rehersal. After giving information meaningful links, recall becomes significantly easier as you are logically led from one item to another.

### Areas of the brain for memory
#### Hippocampus

The hippocampus is a 3.5cm tube-like cortical structure located in the **medial temporal lobe** that has been identified as having a role in the production of memory. Specifically, the hippocampus is believed to be a key area in the production of **declarative memories**.

While **consolidation** of declarative memory occurs within the hippocampus, it is not the final location where the long-term memories are stored, instead they are moved to areas of the brain where they are likely to be processed (e.g visual memories near the occipital lobe).

#### Evidence for the functions of the hippocampus

H.M. or Henry Molaison was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy. In an attempt to treat his seizures, Molaison had the majority of his medial temporal lobe surgically removed. While surgically successful, the operation had the side-effect of seriously damaging his ability to store **new declarative memories**.

Molaison's ability to **recall and learn procedural memories was unaffected**, although he could not recall the learning of the skills (e.g. mirror drawing).

#### Amygdala

The amygdala is a small bulbuous cortical area located at the end of the hippocampus in the medial temporal lobe. The amygdala is involved in the stimulation of memory storage for events that are particularly emotional (e.g fearful or frightening).

#### Evidence for the functions of the amygdala

## Consolidation theory

Consolidation theory suggests that memories are not immediately stored and are instead slowly consolidated. For consolidation to occur, the following must be satisfied:

- Physical change (strengthening of synaptic connections)
- No disruptions (alcohol, knocks to the head) must occur during consolidation
- At least 30 minutes must pass for the memory to 'set'

### Long-term potentiation

Long-term potentiation (or LTP for short) refers to the long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission. Neurons that fire together become sensitive to each other, leading to strengthening of neural pathways.

### Memory over the lifespan

- Tend to decline in short-term memory when dealing with complex tasks, however for simple tasks its fine
- Procedural memories are the most resistant
- Recall of prospective episodic memories is impaired

---

## Forgetting

Forgetting is the inability to retrieve previously stored information.

Psuedoforgetting is like hearing someones name after being introduced to them and 'forgetting it' - this is likely just not having enough time to encode the memory

#### Retrieval failure theory

Retrieval failure theory suggests that forgetting occurs due to an inability to locate the memory being looked for. The memory trace for the memory is available however it is inaccessible without a retrieval cue.

#### Decay theory

Decay theory suggests that memory traces in the brain will fade over time through lack of use and eventually become unavailable.

#### Interference theory

Interference theory suggests that forgetting occurs due to interference by other memories during recall. There are two types of interference that occur: proactive interference and retroactive interference.
