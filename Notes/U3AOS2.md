# Memory

### Encoding, storage, retrieval

The three main processes of memory include encoding, storage, retrieval. Each step is required in order to obtain a working and useful form of memory.

**Encoding is the conversion of information into a useable form**. This can be considered analogous to a keyboard converting key presses into binary information.

**Storage refers to retainment of memory** over time. This can be considered analogous to a hard drive on a computer.

**Retrieval is the locating and recovering** of stored information.

## Models of memory

### Atkinson-Shiffrin's multi-store model of memory

The Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory was designed by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin in 1968. The model focusses on three major systems of memory - sensory, short-term and long-term. Each system interacts with others continually with each system having unique characteristics including storage capacity and storage duration.

#### Sensory memory

Storage capacity: Unlimited
Storage duration: 0.3 - 10 seconds

Sensory memory is split into three subsystems of memory (called sensory registers). Iconic memory, echoic memory and haptic memory. Sensory memory is stored **within the sense organs** and **not the brain**.

**Iconic memory is memory of visual sensory memory**, from the retina. **Echoic memory refers to auditory sensory memory** like sounds heard by the ears. **Haptic memory refers to touch and feeling** that may be felt in the skin.

Sensory memory can be encoded into short-term memory via **attention**. If not attended to, information is simply filtered out of consciousness and forgotten.

#### Evidence of sensory memory

**Sperling (1960)** showed that participants were able to recall greater amounts of information than previously thought. A grid of letters was flashed by a tachistoscope in front of the participants, who were then asked to verbally report as many letters as possible. Most participants could only recall 4 or 5 of the letters.

Sperling then played a tone with a small delay after flashing the letters. The pitch of the tone indicated the row from which the participant should read out. It was observed that participants were able to do so accurately approximately 75% of the time, unlike what would be expected from the previous experiments.

This suggests that while iconic memory is unlimited in capcity, the duration is so short that by the time participants reach the 4th or 5th item, the rest are forgotten.

**Cowan et al. 2000)** asks participants to focus their attention on reading a story while a list of numbers is read aloud. Upon hearing a tone, participants were required to attempt to recall the numbers that they heard. As the delay between hearing numbers and the tone increased, the accuracy of recall reduced.

#### Comparison between types of sensory memory

| Type of memory | Memory duration | Memory capacity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Iconic memory | 0.2 - 0.4 seconds | Unlimited |
| Echoic memory | 3-4 seconds | Unlimited |
| Haptic memory | 9-10 seconds | Unlimited |

#### Short-term memory

Storage capacity: 7 ± 2 items
Storage duration: 18 - 20 seconds

Memories leave short term memory by either **displacement** or **decay**.

| Function | Capacity | Duration | Encoding | Forgetting | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recevies information from sensory memory; receives information from long-term memory; sending information to long-term memory | 7 ± 2 items | ~20 seconds | Mostly acoustic; Attention and rehersal will help store info in STM | Displacement and interference; Possibility of decay | --- |

#### Rehersal

##### Elaborative rehersal

Elaborative rehersal links information in a meaningfully way that **creates cues** to you locate and retrieve the memory later. It's a **more active** process than maintenance rehresal and uses a **'deeper' level of encoding** (refer to the Levels of processing theory).

Elaborative rehersal is the preferred method of rehersal to move memories from STM to LTM as it is **more effective** than maintenance rehersal.

##### Mainenance rehersal

Maintenance rehersal is the process of **repeating information** to yourself in order to remember it. This may be vocally (speaking the words aloud), sub-vocal (speaking words in your head), visualising (keeping an image in your head) or muscularly (imaging how it feels to perform an action). Once maintenance rehersal stops, the memory will typically be **lost after about 20 seconds**.

Maintenance rehersal is very helpful when trying to keep information in short term memory.

#### Long-term memory

Storage capacity: Potentially unlimited
Storage duration: Potentially permanent

Long-term memory works by linking memories to one another in a semantic web. Experiences are linked to other relevant memories. Retrieval cues allow memories to be *found*.

There are different types of memories stored in long term memory.

| Function | Capacity | Duration | Encoding | Forgetting | Example |
| --- | Potentially unlimited | Relatively premanent | Elaborative rehersal & maintenance rehersal | Incorrect cues, interference with other info, motivation, decay | --- |

##### Procedural memory

Refers to knowledge of skills, habits or actions.

##### Declarative memory
##### Semantic memory
##### Episodic memory
##### Explicit and implicit memory
### Semantic network theory

![An example of a semantic network](http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-content/themes/ACT-R/tutorials/unit1_files/image004.gif)

The semantic network theory was first developed by Alan Collins in 1969. The theory contends that long-term memory is organised by **linking concepts** (called nodes) in **meaningful** ways to form a **hierarchical structure** called a network.

When an individual needs to recall something, they begin by searching a 'region' of memory, and then follow cues until they remember the information they required. This theory is also not only efficient in terms of accesibility but also storage, as attributes shared between concepts do not need to be duplicated.

#### Evidence for semantic network theory

#### Questions about semantic network theory

- Why might it be advantageous to organise memories semantically?
- How does elaborative rehersal relate to semantic network theory?
