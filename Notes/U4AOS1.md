# Neural basis of learning

### What is learning?

Learning is a **relatively permanent** change in behaviour that occurs as a result of **experience**. Learning is an **ongoing** process which can be **modified** (i.e. learned actions can be unlearned).

### Behaviour not dependent on learning

Not all changes in behaviour or actions are a result of learning from experience.

#### Reflex actions

A reflex is an inborn automatic and **involuntary** behavioural response (movement) which occurs **the same way every time** in response to a particular stimulus. Reflexes are **simple** responses to stimulus such as a blink or flinch. Often, reflexes exist for **survival purposes** and allow the body to react quickly without processing in the brain. Reflexes are **not specific to certain species** or groups, and may be evident in a variety of species. Many reflexes disappear after passing through infanthood, such as the sucking and grasping reflexes in humans.

##### Examples of reflex actions

- The blinking of an eye when a gust of air is blown into it
- The grasping reflex found in newborn human babies
- Flinching when someone is about to punch you

#### Fixed-action patterns

A fixed-action pattern is an inborn **predisposition to behave in a certain way** in response to a **specific** environmental stimulus that is **characteristic of a species or group**. FAPs are normally made up of a series of **complex actions** which differentiate them from reflexes. It **isn't possible to unlearn FAPs** and is difficult to change them at all as they are a natural part of the behaviour for a particular species. Higher order animals such as humans don't possess many (if any) fixed-action patterns.

##### Examples of fixed-action patterns

- Funnel-web spiders spinning tubular webs to catch prey (very specific)
- Male bowerbird creating a blue coloured mound of twigs to attract a female.
- Salmon swimming upstream to spawn
- Bees dancing to show others where nectar is
- Species of birds which know what time of the year to migrate

#### Behaviour dependent on maturation

Maturation refers to **sequential changes** that the body is genetically programmed to make at predetermined times. These progressions occur at **predictable times and cannot be accelerated** (e.g you cannot teach a 4 month old to walk until they reach the maturational stage for walking).

##### Examples of behaviour dependent on maturation

- Onset of walking
- Onset of talking
- Crawling
- Standing

### Biological basis of learning

Learning occurs through the release of neurotransmitter between neurons which leads to changes in the neural pathways within our brain. Existing connections between neurons can be reorganised in structure, changing their function by 'rewiring' themselves. Our pathways may be strengthened, making communication along a pathway easier in the future.

These physical changes that take place within the brain when learning occurs, are the biological basis or foundation of learning.

Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb proposed that learning results in the creation of **cell assemblies**, groups of interconnected neurons that form networks or pathways. Neurons within a network can send messages to other networks via the neurons in their network since a single neuron may belong to many different networks. This also suggests that a single neuron may play a role in more than one function.

**Hebbian learning** learning can be summarised by 'neurons that fire together, wire together', suggesting that LTP is necessary for learning to occur.

#### Types of neurotransmitter

##### Glutamate

When released during learning, glutamate **initiates activity in the postsynaptic neuron** and is believed to contribute to **synaptic formation** and the **strengthening of existing synapses**.

##### Dopamine

Generally accepted as a neurotransmitter that strengthens a neural connection, dopamines more researched role is related to the **pleasure system**. As a result, dopamine is heavy studied in conjunction with **reward-based learning**. Dopamine is often secreted after winning while gambling, eating a tasty food or when achieving a high score on a video game. the release of the dopamine provides a pleasurable experience, which in turn motivates the individual to repeat the action.

Dopamine is also associated with memory formation.

##### Serotonin

Associated with mood, low levels in patients with depression.

##### Acetylcholine

While the function of acetylcholine is largely unknown, patients with Alzheimer's disease are often found to have very low concerntrations of acetylcholine within their cerebral cortex.

##### Norepinephrine

## Neural plasticity

### Developmental plasticity

#### Synaptogenesis
#### Synaptic pruning

### Adaptive plasticity

### Critical and sensitive periods of development

## Classical conditioning

Classical conditioning was first researched in 1899 by Ivan Pavlov, a Russian physiologist. Classical conditioning refers to a type of learning that occurs through the **repeated association** of two (or more) different stimuli.

### Key components in classical conditioning

Classical conditioning consists of four major components:

- UCS: The **original** stimulus that produces an involuntary response
- UCR: The **original** (involuntary) response to the UCS
- CS: The **conditioned** stimulus that produces an involuntary response after conditioning occurs
- CR: The **conditioned** (involuntary) response to the CS

It is important to note that the CS is a **neutral stimulus** before conditioning occurs. After the CS produces a CR, **conditioning is said to have occurred**. It is also important to note that while the CR may be similar to the UCR, **the CR and UCR are not identical**.

### Steps in classical conditioning

1. Acquisition

⋅⋅⋅During acquisition **an association between the UCS and the CS is established**. This occurs by repeated presentations of the UCS and CS **simultaneously**, this timing is important.

⋅⋅⋅For example in Pavlov's experiments, he studied dogs which **involuntarily salivated** to meat powder. To condition the dogs, **a bell was rung while meat powder was presented** to the dogs. This caused them to associate the sound of the bell ringing with the meat powder being brought out. After a number of trials to strengthen the association, **when the bell was rung alone** the dogs **would still salivate**. At this point **conditioning is said to have occurred**.

2. Extinction

3. Spontaneous recovery

⋅⋅⋅TODO

### Stimulus generalisation and stimulus discrimination

Stimulus generalisation occurs when an organism responds to stimuli that are similar to the CS but not the same. For example the CS may be a knock on a door but an organism may still respond to a knock on the floor.

Stimulus discrimination occurs when an organism responds only to its CS. For example it may respond to its CS (a clap) but not to a similar sound (a hi5).

### Summary

| Name of process | Description of process | Example of process | Key factors influencing the process |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acquisition | The association of an UCS and CS to create a CR by repeated presentations of the UCS and CS together | Playing a buzzer and a administering an electric shock simultaneously | The timing between the presentation of the UCS and CS (should be minimised <1/2 second) |
| Extinction | The gradual decrease in the strength of the CR after the UCS is no longer presented | The lessening levels of salivation in response to the bell in Pavlov's dogs after the meat powder was no longer brought out | The strength of the existing conditioning |
| Spontaneous recovery | The reappearance of the CR after a rest break (when the CS was not presented) when the CR appeared to have been extinguished | Pavlov's dogs salivating in response to a bell the day after an experiment where towards the end the dogs did not salivate in response to the bell | The time since the last exposure of the CS, the strength of the conditioning |
| Stimulus generalisation | A response occurs when a stimulus similar to the CS is presented | A response occurs to a knock on a wooden floor when the CS is a knock on a wooden door | The uniqueness of the CS |
| Stimulus discrimination | A response does not occur when a stimulus similar to the CS is presented | A response does not occur to a knock on a wooden floor when the CS is a knock on a wooden door | The uniqueness of the CS |

## Operant conditioning

Operant conditioning is a learning process in which the **consequences** which follow a response determine whether the behaviour will be repeated. A key distinguishing difference between operant conditioning and classical conditioning is the **choice** in operant conditioning.

Behaviour will likely be repeated when **reinforced**.

Behaviour will not be likely to be repeated when **punished**.
