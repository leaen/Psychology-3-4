# Neural basis of learning

### What is learning?

Learning is a **relatively permanent** change in behaviour that occurs as a result of **experience**. Learning is an **ongoing** process which can be **modified** (i.e. learned actions can be unlearned).

### Behaviour not dependent on learning

Not all changes in behaviour or actions are a result of learning from experience.

#### Reflex actions

A reflex is an inborn automatic and **involuntary** behavioural response (movement) which occurs **the same way every time** in response to a particular stimulus. Reflexes are **simple** responses to stimulus such as a blink or flinch. Often, reflexes exist for **survival purposes** and allow the body to react quickly without processing in the brain. Reflexes are **not specific to certain species** or groups, and may be evident in a variety of species. Many reflexes disappear after passing through infanthood, such as the sucking and grasping reflexes in humans.

##### Examples of reflex actions

- The blinking of an eye when a gust of air is blown into it
- The grasping reflex found in newborn human babies
- Flinching when someone is about to punch you

#### Fixed-action patterns

A fixed-action pattern is an inborn **predisposition to behave in a certain way** in response to a **specific** environmental stimulus that is **characteristic of a species or group**. FAPs are normally made up of a series of **complex actions** which differentiate them from reflexes. It **isn't possible to unlearn FAPs** and is difficult to change them at all as they are a natural part of the behaviour for a particular species. Higher order animals such as humans don't possess many (if any) fixed-action patterns.

##### Examples of fixed-action patterns

- Salmon swimming upstream to spawn
- Spiders spinning webs to catch prey
- Bees dancing to show others where nectar is
- Species of birds which know what time of the year to migrate

#### Behaviour dependent on maturation

Maturation refers to **sequential changes** that the body is genetically programmed to make at predetermined times. These progressions occur at **predictable times and cannot be accelerated** (e.g you cannot teach a 4 month old to walk until they reach the maturational stage for walking).

##### Examples of behaviour dependent on maturation

- Crawling
- Standing
- Walking
