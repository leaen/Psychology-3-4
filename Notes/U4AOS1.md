# Neural basis of learning

### What is learning?

Learning is a **relatively permanent** change in behaviour that occurs as a result of **experience**. Learning is an **ongoing** process which can be **modified** (i.e. learned actions can be unlearned).

### Behaviour not dependent on learning

Not all changes in behaviour or actions are a result of learning from experience.

#### Reflex actions

A reflex is an inborn automatic and **involuntary** behavioural response (movement) which occurs **the same way every time** in response to a particular stimulus. Reflexes are **simple** responses to stimulus such as a blink or flinch. Often, reflexes exist for **survival purposes** and allow the body to react quickly without processing in the brain. Reflexes are **not specific to certain species** or groups, and may be evident in a variety of species. Many reflexes disappear after passing through infanthood, such as the sucking and grasping reflexes in humans.

##### Examples of reflex actions

- The blinking of an eye when a gust of air is blown into it
- The grasping reflex found in newborn human babies
- Flinching when someone is about to punch you

#### Fixed-action patterns

A fixed-action pattern is an inborn **predisposition to behave in a certain way** in response to a **specific** environmental stimulus that is **characteristic of a species or group**. FAPs are normally made up of a series of **complex actions** which differentiate them from reflexes. It **isn't possible to unlearn FAPs** and is difficult to change them at all as they are a natural part of the behaviour for a particular species. Higher order animals such as humans don't possess many (if any) fixed-action patterns.

##### Examples of fixed-action patterns

- Salmon swimming upstream to spawn
- Spiders spinning webs to catch prey
- Bees dancing to show others where nectar is
- Species of birds which know what time of the year to migrate

#### Behaviour dependent on maturation

Maturation refers to **sequential changes** that the body is genetically programmed to make at predetermined times. These progressions occur at **predictable times and cannot be accelerated** (e.g you cannot teach a 4 month old to walk until they reach the maturational stage for walking).

##### Examples of behaviour dependent on maturation

- Crawling
- Standing
- Walking

### Biological basis of learning

Learning occurs through the release of neurotransmitter between neurons which leads to changes in the neural pathways within our brain. Existing connections between neurons can be reorganised in structure, changing their function by 'rewiring' themselves. Our pathways may be strengthened, making communication along a pathway easier in the future.

These physical changes that take place within the brain when learning occurs, are the biological basis or foundation of learning.

Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb proposed that learning results in the creation of **cell assemblies**, groups of interconnected neurons that form networks or pathways. Neurons within a network can send messages to other networks via the neurons in their network since a single neuron may belong to many different networks. This also suggests that a single neuron may play a role in more than one function.

**Hebbian learning** learning can be summarised by 'neurons that fire together, wire together', suggesting that LTP is necessary for learning to occur.

#### Types of neurotransmitter

##### Glutamate

When released during learning, glutamate **initiates activity in the postsynaptic neuron** and is believed to contribute to **synaptic formation** and the **strengthening of existing synapses**.

##### Dopamine

Generally accepted as a neurotransmitter that strengthens a neural connection, dopamines more researched role is related to the **pleasure system**. As a result, dopamine is heavy studied in conjunction with **reward-based learning**. Dopamine is often secreted after winning while gambling, eating a tasty food or when achieving a high score on a video game. the release of the dopamine provides a pleasurable experience, which in turn motivates the individual to repeat the action.

Dopamine is also associated with memory formation.

##### Serotonin

Associated with mood, low levels in patients with depression.

##### Acetylcholine

While the function of acetylcholine is largely unknown, patients with Alzheimer's disease are often found to have very low concerntrations of acetylcholine within their cerebral cortex.

##### Norepinephrine
