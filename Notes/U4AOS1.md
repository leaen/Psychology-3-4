# Neural basis of learning

### What is learning?

Learning is a relatively permanent change in behaviour that occurs as a result of experience.

### Unlearned actions

Not all changes in behaviour or actions are a result of learning from experience.

#### Reflex actions

A reflex is an inborn automatic (involuntary) behavioural response (movement) which occurs the same way every time in response to a stimulus.

- Reflexes can be shared by different species

#### Fixed-action patterns

A fixed-action pattern is an inborn predisposition to behave in a certain way in response to a specific environmental stimulus that is characteristic of a species or group.

- Typically very hard to unlearn or change.
- Differ from reflexes by being a complex set of responses

#### Behaviour dependent on maturation

Maturation refers to sequential changes that the body is genetically programmed to make at predetermined times.

- You cannot speed this up, e.g you can try teaching a child how to walk at 9 months but you won't be able to until the child has the neurological state to accomplish walking
